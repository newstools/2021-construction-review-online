With LNG capacity of approximately 13 million tonnes per annum, the current development will spearhead crucial economic and social investment for Mozambique. ABB’s 26-month project will culminate in a significant installed base in Mozambique for ABB and will involve collaboration across multiple ABB divisions and regions, led by ABB in Singapore. Fourteen large onshore electrical houses (e-houses) or prefabricated electrical substation buildings (PESB) – specifically designed for oil and gas applications, will be built by ABB team in Singapore and transported to the Total-led Mozambique LNG project site. According to Brandon Spencer, President of ABB Energy Industries, winning this project is a testament to ABB’s technical superiority in electrification technologies, as well as the company’s highly skilled management and engineering capabilities. “We are proud to be part of Africa’s economic growth story, especially Mozambique,” he said.

Construction of Heritage Point on the South Aud Block at Canalside in Buffalo in New York has begun. The project includes two approximately 103,000 square feet mixed-use buildings separated by an open walkway that follows a portion of the historic Prime Slip. The US$30 million project will be complete in Fall 2022. With 103,000 gross square feet of space, the mixed-use buildings include up to five floors with an active ground-floor plan that includes retail and restaurants. The remaining floors include office space and a total of 64 mixed-income residential units. The Prime Slip will be evoked through a pedestrian pathway over its former alignment, where it historically linked the Erie Canal with Lake Erie.

The developer will also activate the towpath, sidewalks, and Prime Slip with outdoor seating. These primarily vacant parcels are part of a former superblock that once contained War Memorial Auditorium, a sports and events arena that was demolished by ECHDC in 2009. Sinatra and Co. will receive US$2 million from ECHDC for capital construction costs related to the Prime Slip and sections of Lloyd Street and Canal Street rights of way and canal lighting. Sinatra and Co. will also receive a US$2 million loan from the Better Buffalo Fund. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}A key initiative of Governor Cuomo’s revitalization efforts in Western New York, the Better Buffalo Fund aims to create vibrant, mixed-use, high-density neighborhoods while improving access to the major employment hubs by creating stronger transit and transportation linkages between neighborhoods, employment centers, job training, and services. “Downtown Buffalo’s waterfront revitalization continues to gain steam, and the Heritage Point project adds a residential component for the first time, along with retail and restaurants to attract visitors to what will be a dynamic community and destination,” the governor stated.

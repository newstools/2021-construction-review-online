Honolulu rail project has been included to receive a US$70 million grant from the US$1.9 trillion COVID relief package that is slated to pass through Congress to help cover the hundreds of millions of dollars that Honolulu’s rail transit is projected to lose because of the pandemic. The US Senator Schatz, who was recently appointed Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee’s Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee, secured funding for the rail during House discussions of the bill. The federal funding is expected to help the rail project overcome a recent shortfall in local tax revenue as a result of the ongoing pandemic.

The US$70 million in rail funds in the federal COVID-19 relief bill would cover that amount. “This grant will enable Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transport (HART) to continue working toward its critical path construction goals,” HART Interim Executive Director Lori Kahikina said in a press release recently. However, HART finance officials forecast that rail faces a total COVID-related loss of US$376 million in room and excise tax revenues alone over the life of the project. Indeed, HART’s release on Sunday said the US$70 million will cover “a portion” of the shortfall related to the pandemic. It’s not clear yet how the remaining shortfall will be covered in the years ahead. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));In a statement, Schatz said, “Our goal here was to help the City pay for part of its share by covering the loss in local tax revenue caused by the pandemic. This provides some relief, but HART and the City must still come up with a workable financial plan and get this project up and running for the people of Honolulu.”

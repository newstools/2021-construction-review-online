These containers will be coupled to a thermal power plant with a total power output of 600kW running on diesel fuel that will be supplied by Jovena Madagascar. 1 Also Read: AfDB approves US $43m loan to finance phase 2 of PRIRTEM in Madagascar if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}The facility will also be equipped with an energy storage system and a low voltage distribution network through which power will be supplied to the site at night and even on days when it is closed, will be installed. 1 According to Richard Ferrazi, the Chief Executive Officer of Colas Madagascar, the company is committed to a strategy of decarbonizing its activities. 1 if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};It has therefore set itself the goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by the year 2030, a goal that the mobile hybrid power plant for the Ambokatra quarry will contribute to by avoiding the emission of approximately 90 tonnes of CO2 per year. 1 “Our quarry in Ambokatra will be the first site in the country to be equipped with a hybrid power plant that will significantly reduce its emissions. We also have plans to equip a second site, the PK13 RN7 quarry, located in Antananarivo with a similar facility in the near future,” explained Mr. Ferrazi. 1

The BTA will allow construction of the 200 MW Indiana Crossroads Solar Park in White County, roughly halfway between Indianapolis and Chicago, which is anticipated to become operational in 2022. NIPSCO will enter into a joint venture once construction is complete. The Power Purchase Agreement will enable the construction of the 204 MW Indiana Crossroads II Wind Farm, also in White County. That capacity is expected to become operational in 2023, and NIPSCO will buy the projectâ€™s full capacity.

In July of 2020, the company announced two new projects totaling 300 MW that are set to come online by 2023: the 200 MW Brickyard Solar project and the 100 MW Greensboro Solar project. The Greensboro project will also include 30 MW of battery storage. Both projects will be developed, constructed, owned, and operated by a unit of NextEra Energy Resources; NIPSCO will buy the power through 20-year PPAs. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',115,'0','1'])); .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}In October, the company also announced that they would provide 900 MW of renewable capacity on-line by the end of 2023, across three projects: the Dunns Bridge I, Dunns Bridge II, and Cavalry Solar Energy Centers. Cavalry Solar will be a 200 MW installation coupled with 60 MW of battery storage. It will be located in White County and is expected to be operational in late 2023. Dunns Bridge Solar I, the only project of the three not to include battery storage, is set to be a 265 MW installation.

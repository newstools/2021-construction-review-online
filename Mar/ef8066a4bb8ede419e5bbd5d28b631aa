Sully-Miller Contracting Co. has announced they will remove about 6,000 feet of the runway’s asphalt surface, as well as Taxiways H6 and H7. They will also install new energy-efficient LED runway centerline lights and replace the runway concrete approach slabs at the bridge over Sepulveda Boulevard. The runway, which is typically used for arriving flights, will be temporarily closed during construction, which is expected to last a little over two months, but passengers are not expected to be noticeably impacted, and noise impacts should be minimal, LAX officials announced.

When 7R/25L is a non-operational runway, 7L/25R will handle both arriving and departing flights. Some arrivals may, however, be moved to the north runway complex. Runway resurfacing work is usually done every 10 to 12 years as the runway’s surface reaches the end of the time span it was designed for. Because of runway 7R/25Ls location, noise impacts are expected to be minimal, and overnight over-ocean operations will not be affected. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));“At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we challenged ourselves to use this time of a reduction in air traffic to complete repairs and airfield improvements more efficiently than ever before,” said Bernardo Gogna, chief development officer of Los Angeles World Airports. “The replacement of the asphalt on Runway 7R/25L is an example of how we are investing in the long-term health of our airport and completing work that would have been much more disruptive if done when we were operating at full capacity.”

Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr. Fred Matiang’i recently launched the US $3.1m project which is expected to spur horticulture and fruit farming in the region. According to the CS, once completed the project will ensure local traders get an opportunity to venture in international markets as many export companies will have space for collecting and packaging of fresh produce for overseas markets. Matiang’i was accompanied by ICT CS Joe Mucheru and his Transport, Infrastructure and Urban Development counterpart James Macharia. The six storey building will be served by tarmacked roads linking it to the Naivasha dry port for facilitation of exportation of the produce. The project is expected to be completed within a period of less than a year as funds have been allocated in the current financial year.

Statistics from the International Monetary Fund indicate that the Chinese loan accounts for about 10 percent of South Sudan’s total loans, most of which are commercial loans issued by foreign financial institutions. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};The Chinese embassy said that according to the ongoing gossip, the amount of Chinese loans to the African republic is several times higher than the country’s total external debts. The airport’s renovation works started in 2014 and ended in 2017, with the new-look facility fully handed over to South Sudan. The refurbished airport has been instrumental in the socio-economic development of the world’s youngest nation. According to Shuang, it has led to more than a 60-percent increase in passenger flow while its international flights have tripled. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};“Considering the remarkable revenue generated by the project, we do not foresee any difficulty in repaying the loan for South Sudan.  We also do not expect the loan to increase the debt burden of the West African country so long as both parties commit to the agreement,” affirmed the Spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in South Sudan.

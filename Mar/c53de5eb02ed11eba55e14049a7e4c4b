According to the County Chief water officer Mr. Fidelis Majiwa, the funds will go a long way in helping Migori Water Services Company (MIWASCO) to address persistent water shortages in Migori and Kehancha towns. “I am confident that with the acquisition of the AfDB money, MIWASCO would be able to improve and increase the water distribution lines in order to reach more customers with their services. The money will assist the company to reach more people and boost water pumping and treatment levels, in order to provide enough and quality water to the people,” said the chief officer,” he said.

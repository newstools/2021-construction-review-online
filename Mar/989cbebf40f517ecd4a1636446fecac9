Kenya is set to fast track construction of the Kenol-Makutano-Sagana-Marua highway. This is after the government revised the completion dates of major road projects across the country particularly the Central region. According to Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia, some of the major government projects which include dualing of the 84km Kenol-Makutano (Mwea)-Sagana-Marua highway at US $273.2m will be completed by June next year. “The reason why we have routinely inspected the construction is to ensure that the projects are fast tracked to the new time frame. The president is also closely monitoring and looking forward to their completion,” said CS Macharia.

The road will traverse Murang’a, Kirinyaga and Nyeri counties and is expected to significantly cut travelling times between Nairobi and Central Kenya counties. The contract also includes extending the Thika Superhighway to Kenol Township to ease traffic congestion in the peri-urban area. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};The chairmen also revealed that construction of 540km Mau Mau cluster roads, which was scheduled to be complete by June 2023, will be done by next year.

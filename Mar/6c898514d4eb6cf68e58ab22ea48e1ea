Grove Central Miami will be located at the intersection of S. Dixie Highway (US1) and SW 27th Avenue, which will include a 23-story residential tower with 402 multifamily, workforce, and co-living units. A new 1,250-space public parking garage and approximately 170,000 square feet of neighborhood-oriented retail anchored by Target will also be developed.

The facility has been designed to create a transit-oriented hub offering a seamless pedestrian experience that encourages Metrorail ridership and urban living. Grove Central is being developed as part of a Miami-Dade County initiative aimed at improving connectivity between residential living, commercial development, and mass transit through private development on county-owned land. Terra and Grass River Property have entered into a 90-year ground lease with the county which enables the partnership to build, manage and lease the property. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}“Terra is focused on advancing a sustainable and resilient development model that combines residential density, a balanced mix of commercial uses, and access to multimodal transit options. Grove Central will bring this vision to life along with one of Miami’s most important transit corridors, creating an everyday amenity for nearby residents and filling a void in our housing market,” said Terra CEO David Martin. “Grove Central is a model for the future of development and mobility in Miami-Dade County,” said Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava. “Creating a more sustainable, resilient community means getting people out of their cars, making transit more accessible, and creating new workforce housing opportunities.”

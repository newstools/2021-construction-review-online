Mr Kamabare further added that the gas will be supplied mainly to public hospitals across Uganda but private facilities will be considered too. NMS’ mandate is to procure, warehouse, and distribute essential medicines and medical supplies, primarily to government health facilities. Medicine availability across the country currently stands at 85% with a target of reaching 90% within the next 1-2 years. NMS recently hired clerks to follow up on drugs from the districts up to the rural health facilities under what is known as the last-mile delivery model.

Dangote Petroleum Refinery and Petrochemicals have built a Jetty using Sandbar Breakwater technology to reduce coastal erosion and protect the shorelines. Furthermore, the jetty will allow fishing activities in Lekki communities, putting to rest the fears of fishermen in that region. Speaking on behalf of the Head of Maritime & Ports Infrastructure, Dangote Oil Refining Company Limited, Capt. Rajen Sachar, the General Manager (Survey), Dangote Oil Refining Company Limited, Rajnish Kumar Gupta, explained that the Sandbar Breakwaters don’t interfere with wildlife habitats. “They may change how wave transmission energy occurs, but this doesn’t change the fact that the animals will still have a place that they can call home,” he said. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));According to Kumar Gupta, the facility is built in a way that it can handle large vessels of up to 16,000 metric tonnes (MT).

This will eliminate road transport risk and support the timely and successful construction of the refinery in line with the aspiration of Nigerians and investors. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1','ezslot_4',612,'0','0']));Having crossed all hurdles, the 650,000 barrels a day Dangote refinery will commence full production by early next year.

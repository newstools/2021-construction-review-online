Four pedestrian footbridges are set to be demolished and relocated to new sites to pave way for the new Nairobi Expressway road that is currently under construction. The first two footbridges are situated at Mlolongo and Imara Daima near Libra House along Kenya’s first-double decker highway; while the other two are situated at General Motors on Enterprise Road and at St Mark’s church in Westlands, Nairobi. According to Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) director-general Peter Mundinia, the four pedestrian bridges are being demolished and relocated to new sites along the corridor. “This is a normal thing in road construction,” he said.

The footbridges we are demolishing are made of steel. This means that we are not going to put into waste any parts demolished,” he added. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_0',117,'0','0']));The four bridges on the 27.1km road that links the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to Nairobi-Nakuru highway were built between 2009 and 2015 at a cost of US $3.5m. The three-year Nairobi Expressway project, launched in October last year, is projected to ease heavy traffic on Mombasa Road, Uhuru Highway and Waiyaki Way.

Let’s start by saying that concrete mixers are essential for the people that work in the construction field. A concrete mixer must have some design features to get a perfect final result.  if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;} The combination of these two elements makes the mixture drop down when it gets at the top part of the drum, so that it’s mixed again. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};   if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};A very important detail to prevent the material from settling at the bottom of the drum. (this would mean a wrong mix and material not being mixed in the drum)    In case you need to replace them, they will be easy to replace; besides welding makes the drum weaker. For this same reason a drum with an only central welding is preferable.    In a concrete mixer, the  diesel or petrol engine should be fitted on shock absorbers to protect the structure of the frame and reduce vibrations during use.  We, at Lino Sella have always considered the needs of the final users, creating a machine efficient and resistant; at its maximum level.

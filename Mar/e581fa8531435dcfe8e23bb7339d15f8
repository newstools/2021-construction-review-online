The plant was constructed by Eiffage S.A., a French civil engineering construction company in partnership with TEDAGUA (Técnicas de Desalinización de Aguas, S.A), a Spanish firm engaged in the design, construction, and operation of desalination plants, systems for producing drinking water from brackish feed water, and plants for recycling water from sewerage feed water, and a subsidiary of the  Moncobra, S.A. The aim of the project is to improve the supply of potable water, in the Horn of Africa country that faces repeated water stress. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_6',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_7',115,'0','1'])); .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}The newly commissioned wind-powered water treatment plant in Djibouti has a capacity of 22,500 m3 of water per day which is capable of serving approximately 250,000 citizens.

The local authorities have also announced that they wish to boost the capacity of the facility to about 45,000 m3 per day once the Peper project (Production of drinking water by renewable energy), whose implementation started back in 2017, is completed. With the latter development additional 250 000 Djiboutians will be served. The Peper project is an essential course for Djibouti as it will help the country in the horn of Africa to embark on the development of non-conventional water resources, a necessity in a drought-stricken part of Africa.

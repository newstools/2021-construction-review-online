The 72-year-old dam created the 4.4-billion gallon reservoir that supplies the majority of the city’s water in 1949 when it was created. The project is scheduled only for discussion during the council’s caucus session with a final vote planned for April 20. City engineer Bob Bianchi said water has been seeping under and through portions of the dam since the 1970s, but he stressed there is no threat to the dam’s soundness.

The City Engineer also stated that the city had not been able to procure grant funds for the work and that money for the project will come from the city’s water fund, allocated in the 2021 budget. Seepage must, however, be controlled to prevent erosion of the embankment or foundation materials or damage to concrete structures. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}“There is no potential problem right now,” Bianchi said. “This is to prevent a potential problem. The dam is functioning as intended and we have no concern for any major problems.” The lake together with 1,000 acres of surrounding land is available for picnicking, boating, fishing, camping, hiking, hunting and other forms of recreation are available. Clear Fork Reservoir is accessible not only to the residents of Mansfield but also to individuals who seek relaxation at this beautiful site. The elevation of the spillway is 1202 feet above sea level. 90% of the lake is more than 10 feet deep and 40 foot depths are not uncommon. The capacity of the reservoir is 4.4 billion gallons at the 1202 elevation level.

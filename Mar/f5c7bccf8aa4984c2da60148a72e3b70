The project covers the two municipalities of Badaguichi and Allakaye and the movements of Illela and Bouza. It has a planned water retention capacity of 2.3 million cubic meters (m3) with a dam and development of 400 ha and protection of the watershed. The entire project is funded by the State government of Niger in cooperation with its German counterpart. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};Niger faces recurrent food crises due to erratic and insufficient rainfall, among other things. According to a survey conducted in April 2010 by the National Early Warning System indicate that over 7 million persons, or 46% of the West African country population, live in a situation of moderate (25.5%) to severe (22.2%) food insecurity. Upon completion, the Kaoura-Foga dam project is thus expected to address this issue by contributing to the development of agricultural activities through the intensification of irrigated crops, the practice of fish farming, and the fodder production over a ​​400 ha piece of land. This will have a direct impact on the incomes of more than 15,000 households and a positive impact for the region surrounding the project, which is part of Niger’s decision to retain water resource mobilization as the cornerstone of its Rural Development Strategy (RDS), geared towards guaranteeing national food security.

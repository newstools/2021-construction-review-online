The funds, totaling up to around US$ 1M, will be handed over to Renewable Energy Innovators Cameroon (REIc), a social enterprise based in the West African country that is developing the project in question in partnership with SimpliPhi Power, a growing and innovative technology company based in California, USA, that designs, builds and sells a portfolio of non-toxic, efficient, energy-dense storage and management systems that seamlessly integrate renewable energy in conjunction with or independent of the grid. The feasibility study will be carried out by SimpliPhi Power in collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a subsidiary of the US Department of Energy that specializes in the research and development of renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy systems integration, and sustainable transportation. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}Morua Power, a US-based Latina-owned global engineering company and platform for world-class power systems and technology will too contribute to the feasibility study that will also include the design and monitoring of a pilot mini-grids project.

According to reports, in Cameroon, only 27% of all the households have access to electric energy, and energy poverty is even more marked in rural areas where 70% of the rural population (approximately 60% of the entire Cameroonians) do not have access to electricity.

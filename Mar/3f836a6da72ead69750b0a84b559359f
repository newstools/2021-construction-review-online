The House of Representative in Liberia has mandated its Committee on Public Works to launch an inquiry into the abrupt standstill of the Gbarnga-Konia Road Construction project. The decision was as a result of a letter jointly written by several lawmakers of Lofa County including Francis Sakila Nyumalin, Julie Fatorma Wiah and Cllr. Beyan D. Haword, calling for the House’s intervention over the delay in the road construction project.

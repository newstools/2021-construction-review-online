The Theatre is the Capital Region’s only professional producing theatre and is a 28,000 square foot facility that includes a 300-seat stage and auditorium; a 100-seat “black box” theater; wardrobe and props construction and storage facilities; and an extensive dressing room and actor preparation space. This project undertook a historic restoration and adaptive reuse of the vacant original bakery, which in recent decades was used largely as a storage facility. Refinished original hardwood floors and extensive exposure of brick walls and original wooden timber beams define the interior space.

The US$14 million project was supported by thousands of individual donors and subscribers through a capital campaign. Empire State Development has agreed to provide US$1.8 million through Round 5 of the Restore New York Communities Initiative, and US$950,000 through the Round V of the Regional Council initiative, as recommended by the Capital Region’s Regional Economic Development Council. New York State Homes and Community Renewal is providing $2 million through its Rural and Urban Community Investment Fund, and the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation has agreed to provide federal and state Historic Preservation Tax Credits that generated US$5.2 million in equity. Over the last decade, the Historic Tax Credit program has spurred more than US$12 billion in private investment in more than 1,000 buildings across New York State. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}The governor stated; “New York’s vibrant arts and entertainment venues have been among the pandemic’s hardest-hit businesses, and their expected reopening under strict state guidance is a welcome part of the state’s recovery from COVID-19.”

SRCIP is part of an international community-supported multi-period operation whose projects are drawn from the African Development Bank (AfDB)’s administered Multi-Partner Somalia Infrastructure Fund (SIF). Basically, the SRCIP aims to improve management of the road sector in the East African country at the national level and to improve transport connectivity for road users in the targeted road corridors for rehabilitation while reinforcing the capacities of federal and regional institutions that manage road infrastructure.

This includes the 327 kilometers Beled Weyne – Galka’yo road, which is an important section of Somalia’s North-South (NS) Corridor. Mainly the road is set for a general overhaul and triple surface treatment. The 240 Galkayo – Garowe road, between Galkaiyo and Garowe town in Galmudug and Puntland States respectively, will also undergo renovation thanks to the EU fund. The funds will also enable the grading and compacting of the 80 kilometers Luuq Gane – Dolow wide road, as well as the construction of a 100 kilometers, compacted gravel road that will complement the 241 gravel feeder road on the Hobyo – Galkayo road. Other than funding the infrastructure projects, the EU is looking to implement the SRCIP through the AfDB once both institutions sign an implementation contract.

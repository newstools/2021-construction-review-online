They will allow the gradual return of the workers who had been evacuated, and the resumption of construction activities,” read the statement. The statement further added that, control over the Afungi special security area continues to be guaranteed exclusively by the public security forces under the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the government and Total. The special security area covers the zone within a 25km perimeter around the LNG project. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_3',117,'0','0']));“The Government of Mozambique is committed that the personnel assigned to the protection of Mozambique LNG shall act according to the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR) and international human rights standards”, said a Total statement on the resumption of activities, insisting that the project itself “does not use the services of any armed private security suppliers,” the statement affirmed. Total said that Mozambique LNG has satisfied all the conditions precedent and complied with all relevant statutory requirements for the first debt drawdown of the project financing signed on 15th July 2020 with eight export credit agencies, 19 commercial banks and the African Development Bank. This first drawdown will take place at the beginning of April 2021. The oil and gas company remains optimistic that the project will be able to deliver its first shipment of LNG in 2024.

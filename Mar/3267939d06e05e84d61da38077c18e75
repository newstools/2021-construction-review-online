The newly built Malawi-Zambia one-stop border post at Mchinji/Mwami border is expected to boost trade between the two countries. According to Malawi High Commissioner to Zambia Warren Gunda, the project, although long overdue, will ease business transactions between the two neighbouring countries. “I caution the institutions manning this one-stop border-post to serve people crossing into either country professionally,” he said during an inspection tour of the new facility in Mchinji.

The new facility will lessen redundancy as it will accommodate agencies from both countries in one roof, lessening the time taken for travellers and goods to be cleared,” she added. Mchinji Border Post Immigration Department public relations officer Madalitso Banda said the one-stop border-post will be user-friendly. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_5',117,'0','0']));Roads and highway engineer Peter Kabalata, who is also the project’s acting team leader, said the facility, whose construction started in September 2018, will be operational soon after the current defects and liability period ends. It is expected to open in June this year. The Malawi-Zambia one-stop border post project was funded by the African Development Bank (AfDB).

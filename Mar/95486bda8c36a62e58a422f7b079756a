Construction of the Green Park Terminus in Nairobi, Kenya is currently 98% complete, with only final touches currently ongoing. President Uhuru Kenyatta recently inspected the Terminus which is being constructed by the Nairobi Metropolitan Services with the aim of decongesting the Central Business District. Green Park is among six other bus termini that are currently being constructed by NMS that will officially be pick up and drop off points once matatus are barred from the CBD. Once complete, Green Park will host Matatus plying Ngong road route. However, this did not materialize. Instead, Badi announced in late January 2021 that the terminus will now be ready in February 2021 when it will be officially opened for use by the transport stakeholders. This is yet to materialize as we approach the end of March 2021.

To secure the commission’s permit Bellwether Financial Group had to meet a series of conditions placed upon the project by the commission in September. Among those, they agreed to create an environmental justice program to expose underserved youth from inland communities to water activities, a plan for protecting the harbor sea lions while the project is underway, and a plan for enhancing water quality in the harbor.

Under the public-private partnership, the developers will design, fund, and build the improvements, then operate those portions of the harbor with the 66-year lease before returning the property to the county. Bryon Ward, of Burnham-Ward Properties, and Bob Olson, of R.D. Olson Development, will work together on the harbor’s commercial core. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}With the Coastal Commission’s green light for the construction of the new marina, Ueberroth, the founder, and president of Bellwether will next submit permit drawings to the county and then pull permits to begin work. The new marina is expected to cost around US$100 million and, so far, the projected costs are on course, Ueberroth said.  The plan includes providing ocean experiences to 1,000 children a year. And with being on the water comes the ability to swim. So, Bellwether has partnered with local YMCAs to help fund swimming lessons and provide outreach to the community. Big Brothers Big Sisters, OC Youth Sailing, and the Surfrider Foundation are among other groups involved.

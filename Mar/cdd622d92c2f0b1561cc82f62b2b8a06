Located in Throckmorton County, Texas, the 350 MW wind farm paired with approximately 137 MW of battery storage will be Enel’s third hybrid project in the United States that integrates a renewable energy plant with utility-scale battery storage. Through a 100 MW virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA), Enel will sell a 360 GWh portion of the electricity annually-generated by the Azure Sky wind project to the Kellogg Company, which is equal to 50% of the volume of electricity used across Kellogg’s North American manufacturing facilities.

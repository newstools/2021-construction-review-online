The Ugandan cabinet recently approved a proposal to build a Satellite Ground Station in Uganda to develop space capabilities in a well-coordinated and harmonized manner. The proposed satellite station will lead to: Increased evidence-based technology information for planning and decision making; improved space science and technology infrastructure to support research for industrial development for the country; and improved defence and security through improved capabilities for cross border movement monitoring and surveillance for the country. It will also ensure: Increased private sector investment in space science, technology, research and innovation. This will, in the end, enhance foreign direct investment and collaborations, which will, in turn, attract or spur development for new technologies in the country; improved national earth observation and remote sensing centres for the country; improved application of space science and technology to the social, economic, political and environmental needs of the country while ensuring that Uganda also becomes a significant user and player of the outer space; and increased Human Resource capacity to facilitate the development of space technology in the country.

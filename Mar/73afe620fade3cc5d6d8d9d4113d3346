Overwhelmed by Ethiopia’s determination to complete the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Sudan, after its counterpart Egypt, has called for the intervention of the international community in the filling of the dam hoping to obtain a filling that takes into account its concerns. According to the Sudanese Foreign Minister H.E. Asma Mohamed Abdalla, already the North African country’s Prime Minister Mr. Abdalla Hamdok has officially written to the African Union (AU), the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), and the United States of America to formally request their mediation on the waters of the Nile. This comes following the announcement of phase two filling of the dam by the government of Ethiopia.  Sudan fears that this second filling will lay on the line of its hydraulic safety.

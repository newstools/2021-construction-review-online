This phase dubbed the Tamale’s road network project, concerns the asphalt overlay of 100 kilometers of feeder roads in the towns of Tamale, Walewale, Nalerigu, Gambaga, Damongo, and Yendi, all in the Northern Region of the West African country. The funds in question are provided by the Exportkreditnämnden (EKN), a government agency tasked with promoting Swedish exports and the internationalization of Swedish companies, and the Swedish Export Credit Corporation (SEK), a state-owned company that finances Swedish exporters, their subsidiaries, and foreign customers, and mobilized by the Standard Chartered Bank of Ghana.

It will also help improve regional networks in the Northern Region and consequently increase the flow of business, agricultural trade, and market access particularly in Tamale Metropolitan Area, the capital city of the Northern Region of the West African country that is considered as the hub of trade with many other members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

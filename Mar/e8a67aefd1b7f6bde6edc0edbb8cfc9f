The facility will be built on a 270 hectares piece of land by a joint venture between East African Holding, a leading industrial group in Ethiopia that has endorsed a prominent role in the industrialization of the country, and West China Cement Limited (WCC), a leading cement manufacturer and distributor in North Western China at a cost US$ 2.2bn. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed in a year and a half. The realization of the entire industrial complex that according to authorities will include large factories producing cement, glass, gypsum, etc., will not only fulfill the country’s efforts to substitute imported products but also help to reduce the growing demand for construction materials to some extent. It will also create jobs for up to 10,000 people, and inspire local development.

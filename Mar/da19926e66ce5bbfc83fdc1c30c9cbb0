South Africa’s long-awaited US $2.46bn Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) is expected to be operational in 2027. According to the Department of Water and Sanitation, the building of roads, accommodation and electricity installations had begun, and that border closures due to COVID-19 would not have a “material impact. “COVID-19 disruptions are not expected to have a material impact on the planned completion date of project works and commencement date of water delivery to South Africa, in early 2027,” said the department.

Phase one started delivering water in 1996. Phase two, which includes the 2.3 billion cubic metre Polahli Dam and a 1,200MW hydro-electric plant in Lesotho, was meant to be complete by 2020. Tunneling for the project was carried out late last year. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_3',117,'0','0']));The Dam is being built downstream of the confluence of the Orange-Senqu and Khubelu Rivers in the Mokhotlong District of Lesotho. It will allow the formation of a reservoir on the Orange and Khubelu Rivers over an area of 5,053 hectares, with a total storage capacity of 2,325 million m³. The dam will be supported by a saddle dam, which is an auxiliary reservoir built to confine the reservoir created by a primary dam, either to allow for higher water elevation and storage or to limit the extent of the reservoir in order to increase its yield. According to the Department, the over US $4.1bn needed by the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority (TCTA), South Africa’s state-owned company responsible for the Lesotho project, would be generated through further debt issuance.

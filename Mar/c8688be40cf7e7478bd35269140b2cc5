The project in question will be carried by Vergnet Hydro, a commercial manual pump manufacturer based in France, and its Togolese partner, ECM SARL L’Entreprise de Construction Mécanique (ECM), a mechanical construction company specialized in pump technology, solar energy, water treatment, and metal construction. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_4',117,'0','0']));With a total cost of over US$ 12m, the PASSCO 2 project is supported by the government of France through Agence Française de Développement (AFD) Group, whose main objective is to fund, support, and accelerate the transition to a fairer and more sustainable world. With the new facilities commissioned under Passco 1 and 2, the Savannah and Kara regions will have a total of 1,000 human-powered pumps.

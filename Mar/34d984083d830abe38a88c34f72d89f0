South Africa has announced an auction to procure 1.6GW of wind energy. According to Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) Minister, Gwede Mantashe, the auction is in line with the gazetted IRP2019. This procurement window, will add vitally needed power capacity to the country, which continues to struggle with strangled energy supply, an ongoing crisis that is economically crippling and has seen South Africa buckling under the strain of load shedding for the last few years.

Plus, they do not always require grid expansion, as hybrid grids produce power at different intervals and during complementary seasons.

Chingaza applauded FDH Bank plc for the support that has come at the right time when Ndirande Police has recently been upgraded to a full police station thus we had inadequate office space. “The coming in of FDH Bank plc with the office extension is a great achievement to us as police, as Southern region police, as South West region. We are very happy and honoured for this gift. The structure will make a great difference with a great impact on serving the people of Nyambadwe and Ndirande. With the increased space, the standards of service will be highly improved because our response time will be increased since more officers will be on duty,” she said. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_5',117,'0','0']));“Ndirande Police Station as a parent station has 150 police officers, the challenge was that some of the offices were under trees. The extension of the police station means that these officers will be accommodated in the new officers therefore improving the service standards required by the community,” she added.

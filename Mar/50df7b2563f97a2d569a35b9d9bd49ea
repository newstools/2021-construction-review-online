The Ministry of Public Works, the Maputo Municipality, and representatives of the Dutch government and of AICS signed the two agreements covering these areas in Maputo. According to the Minister of Public Works, Joao Machatine, there could not have been a better way to mark World Water Day. “The agreement we signed with Holland is intended to build capacity for AIAS, and to support the operators of water supply systems, whereas the one signed with Maputo Municipality is intended to improve the municipal sanitation services, based on performance,” he said. He further added that the government is committed to reaching a 90% clean water supply coverage in urban areas and 70% in the rural areas by 2024; under the Action Plan designed for the implementation of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). It also envisages an increase to 80% of sanitation services in the urban areas and 55% in the rural areas.

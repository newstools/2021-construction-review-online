The housing designs will involve two and three-bedroomed flats, with social amenities such as water and sewer reticulation and electricity from renewable energy. The designs fit well into the Smart City concept. The alternative technology will expedite works and save costs by up to half, with up to a thousand units being constructed in 15 months,” she said.

Construction materials will be produced locally, with the Harare Institute of Technology manufacturing the formers for the walling blocks. The minister said that the new technology will benefit the nation immediately through technology transfer for the country’s entrepreneurs and skills development among the youths at training institutions. “Some of the areas that will instantly benefit are former Messengers’ Camps in Highfield, Harare, and Senga in Gweru to be followed by a similar regeneration programme across the country,” she added. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};“This year 88 blocks of flats are being built in Harare’s Dzivarasekwa, each block with 16 flats to give a total of 1 408 flats. The Government is building half and the private sector the other half. Treasury has provided funds in excess of US $1bn in order for construction to commence,” said Minister Mutsvangwa.

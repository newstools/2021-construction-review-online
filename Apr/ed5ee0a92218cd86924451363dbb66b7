Alberta, the Canada-based data center developer PointOne is now soliciting tenants for NAP of Virginia Beach as it moves forward on the first of two planned 39,530-square-foot data center buildings. The project at Corporate Landing Business Park was originally announced in late 2018 with the intent of finishing the first phase in the second half of  2019. The company is waiting to secure agreements with what the CEO calls primary anchor customers before finishing construction.

He expected the first phase to create around 30 positions with an average yearly salary of US$65,000. Colin Clish, PointOne chief operating officer, said design, permitting, and even site foundation work has already started at NAP (Network Access Point) of Virginia Beach. The process was paused when around 10-12 months of work remained for crews because some clients moved back their timetables for occupying the space due to the coronavirus pandemic, said facility general manager Kelly Newman. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','1'])); .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}The Virginia Beach data center construction connection point links to a trio of high-speed subsea cables, including the MAREA and BRUSA cables and Google’s new Dunant cable. The latter became ready for service in February and connects Virginia Beach with France. A fourth cable called Confluence-1 will span from the New York City area to near Miami, Florida, with branch lines to Virginia Beach, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Jacksonville Beach, Florida. It has not been decided whether Confluence-1 will connect to the PointOne facility.

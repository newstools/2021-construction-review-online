The company has already started shipping large quantities of photovoltaic (PV) modules for what it says is the “backbone” of the solar park in Angola . The company, which has dual headquarters in South Korea and Germany, is supplying a total of 287.1MW of modules of the Q.PEAK L-G4.5 model for two of the seven individual solar parks that will form the cluster. More specifically, it will equip a 188MW facility in the commune of Biopio, Benguela province, and another plant in the same province. According to Q Cells, a consortium of Swedish and South African lenders, with coverage from Swedish and South Korean ECAs, have financed the project. In particular, the Swedish Export Credit Corporation (SEK) has arranged an export credit line that covers 85% of the total cost. It is guaranteed by the Swedish Export Credit Agency (EKN) and arranged by ING Bank. The remaining 15% are bankrolled by South African lender DBSA. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));Portugal-based engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm MCA will realise the project, having worked with Sunafrica on its development.

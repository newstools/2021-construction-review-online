The renewal work on these projects is expected to provide improved transportation for both local and interstate travel. The project is scheduled to commence in May 2021 and will take approximately two years to complete. This project consists of the removal and replacement of existing concrete pavement, the design, and replacement of four bridge structures, and widening and adding lanes to portions of the highway. Two of the bridges will be constructed utilizing Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC), a construction method that involves the use of advanced technologies to assemble a bridge offsite and then transport it to a project site for installation.

ABC is of great value to project owners as it dramatically shortens the amount of time it takes to replace an existing bridge, which translates into substantially reduced traffic impacts and inconvenience to motorists in the area around a job site. Additionally, ABC substantially improves work zone safety for both drivers and contractor personnel and minimizes environmental impact, relative to conventional bridge construction methods,” Joe Cutillo, Sterling’s CEO stated. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','1'])); .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}Mr. Cutillo continued, “We are pleased that UDOT has selected us to continue our work in the Salt Lake City area. The stretches of I-80 and I-215 that we’ll be working on run through rapidly growing suburbs in Salt Lake County, where increasing vehicular usage and winter weather have significantly worn the roadway surfaces. Once completed, this project will improve both traffic flow and safety for motorists traveling throughout the region. The design-build aspect of this project significantly reduces the risk on larger-scale jobs.”

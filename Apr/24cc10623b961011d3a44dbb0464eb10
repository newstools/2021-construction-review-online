Through a rigorous focus on costs and capital discipline, Tullow Energy believes that these assets have the potential to generate material cash flow over the next decade and deliver significant value for the country and investors. The 2021 Ghana offshore drilling campaign is the first part of Tullow’s 10-year Business Plan that was presented at Tullow’s Capital Markets Day in November last year. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_5',117,'0','0']));Throughout this campaign, Tullow plans to continue to implement its Shared Prosperity strategy through a strong local content program with suppliers in Ghana, the professional and technical development of Ghanaian nationals, and continued investment in STEM education, enterprise development, and shared infrastructure. “Today is an important milestone in the implementation of our long-term Business Plan. Working closely with the Government of the Republic of Ghana and our joint venture partners in this West African country, I am confident that we will unlock the full potential from the Jubilee and TEN fields through this multi-year, multi-well drilling program,” commented Rahul Dhir, the Chief Executive Officer for Tullow Oil plc.

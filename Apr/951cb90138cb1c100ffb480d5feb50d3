The 175,000-square-foot multimodal parking facility and commuter parking facility on Fleetwood Street serves rail riders others at the new train station. The multi-level 175,000 square foot parking facility is key to the success of the train station, which currently offers Amtrak service but is expected to provide SEPTA Regional Rail service in the future. The facility will also feature bus transportation integration, covered waiting shelters, bike racks, ample lighting, wayfinding signage, and nearly 500 parking spaces to support SEPTA, Amtrak, and Link and Kraft Bus transportation services.

The Coatesville RDA is now working with the City to construct the facility to support the train station, widely considered a lynchpin of the city’s ongoing revitalization plans and strategic economic development vision. The funding, approved today by the Commonwealth Finance Authority, comes through Act 89 of 2013, Pennsylvania’s Comprehensive Transportation Funding Plan, which increased transit funding and established dedicated multimodal funding for aviation, passenger rail, rail freight, port, and bicycle-pedestrian projects. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};“Investments in Coatesville’s transportation infrastructure will pay dividends in the economic success of the city and economic opportunities for its residents,” state Sen. Carolyn Comitta said. “Pairing the new train station with this parking and transportation facility will make Coatesville a true multi-modal transit hub. With more commuters, more rail riders, and more visitors come more customers, more jobs, and more investment dollars.” Earlier this year, Comitta and a state representative announced a US$1 million Pennsylvania Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program (RACP) to support the parking facility, which comes with a total estimated price tag of more than US$10 million.

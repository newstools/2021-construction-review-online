The project started off with a plateau of nearly 600 million cubic feet of natural gas per day but is expected to reach 900 million cubic feet per day and 30,000 barrels per day of condensate. The field’s gas is sent to a new onshore processing facility, situated alongside the existing West Nile Delta onshore processing plant. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center !important;}The Raven gas project represents the third stage of the US$ 9bn West Nile Delta (WND) development, which comprises five gas fields across the North Alexandria and West Mediterranean Deepwater offshore concession blocks.

In total, the WND development consists of 25 wells producing gas to the onshore plant via three long-distance subsea tiebacks. The onshore facilities have a total gas processing capacity of around 1.4 bcf/d, all supplied to the North Africa country’s national grid. “Working together with the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum and our partners we can now explore the potential use of the West Nile Delta facilities for developing future infill and nearby exploration opportunities,” said Karim Alaa, the British multinational oil and Gas Company’s regional president for North Africa. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};BP operates the WND with an 82.75% interest while the remainder is controlled by the Wintershall Dea, Europe’s leading independent natural gas and Oil Company.

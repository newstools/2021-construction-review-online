The Kazungula bridge in Southern Africa is set to be commissioned in May this year. The president of Zambia Dr Edgar Chagwa Lungu has invited his Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) counterpart Mr FÃ©lix Tchilombo Tshisekedi to take part in the commissioning. According to President Lungu, the invitation is important so that Congo can be inspired by what Zambia and Botswana have done. President Tshisekedi expressed his joy to be invited to open the Kazungula bridge because DRC is also building a bridge over the Luapula river. The invite was extended during bilateral talks between the two presidents at the African Union Arena in Kinshasa, DRC.

The project includes a bridge linking Botswana and Zambia over the Zambezi River to replace the existing ferry, and a one-stop border facility at Kazungula. Construction of the bridge by Daewoo Engineering and Construction started back in November 2015 after the ground-breaking ceremony was held on the Botswana side of the Kazungula border. The ground-breaking ceremony was led by Vice President Guy Scott and his Botswana counterpart, Ponatshego Kedikilwe. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};The bridge is expected to significantly improve trade infrastructure of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African continent as a whole. One-stop border facilities will be erected in both countries with a 930-metre-long and 18.5-metre-wide road-rail bridge. The bridge would provide vital transport infrastructure on that corridor as it would facilitate easy access to intra-regional trade and international market through connectivity with major sea ports.

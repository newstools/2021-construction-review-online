Franklin City Manager Judie Milner said; ” We are re-inventing ourselves in the outdoor recreation community and the whitewater park is the anchor, but we have several other things going on. This area around us is kind of on the outskirts of the Lakes Region and has been forgotten, so all of this area we’ll build back up.” The purpose behind the park was to bring tourism to a city that needs it. The river will be maintained thanks to cabin and tent site rental fees. But the use of the trails, parkour area, and whitewater features at the new park will be completely free

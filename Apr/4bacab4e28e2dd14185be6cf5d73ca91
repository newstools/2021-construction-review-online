The solar power plant facility at Farquhar Island consists of 510 panels and it is capable of delivering 250 kWp that is enough to cater to 94% of the electricity needs of the entire island. The second installation in Astove Island is capable of delivering 150 kWp generated through 342 solar panels. The produce can supply 93% of the households and small businesses on the entire Island.

The first solar facility was inaugurated in November 2018 on Alphonse. Glenny Savy, has disclosed that a fourth, much bigger solar farm is under construction on Desroches and that it is expected to come online in June this year. The station, according to IDC’s managing director will have a capacity of 2.5 megawatts. “By June 2022, most, if not all, of the islands managed by the IDC will be using solar energy, which means that we will be using 100% green energy,” affirmed Glenny Savy.

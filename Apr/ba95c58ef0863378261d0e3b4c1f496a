It includes the development of six fields and the drilling of around 400 wells from 31 locations. Production will be delivered through buried pipelines to a treatment plant built in Kasenyi, for the separation and treatment of the fluids (oil, water, gas. All of the water produced will be reinjected into the fields and the gas will be used to produce the energy needed for the treatment process. Surplus electricity will be exported to the pipeline and the Ugandan grid. One of the fields developed is located inside Murchison Falls Park. The others are located outside the Park, south of the Victoria Nile in sparsely populated rural areas and activities that are essentially agricultural.

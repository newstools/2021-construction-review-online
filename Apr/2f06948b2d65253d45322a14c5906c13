The decades-old Strait of Gibraltar underwater railway tunnel project, which is expected to link Morocco and Spain, and Africa to Europe at large, is coming back to life. The project was discussed in a videoconference, held on Wednesday, April 21 between Abdelkader Amara, the Moroccan Minister of Transport, and his Spanish counterpart José Luis Abalos. The two ministers agreed to convene a new joint intergovernmental meeting that will be held in the coming months in Casablanca, the Moroccan capital, during which files concerning the railway tunnel project will be put back on the table.

The research companies in question are the National Society for Strait of Gibraltar Studies (SNED) in Rabat and the Sociedad Española de Estudios para the Comunicación Fija a través del Estrecho de Gibraltar, SA (SECEGSA) in Madrid. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};Back in 2006, engineers involved in the project declared that the tunnel could be commissioned by 2025, subject to technical feasibility studies. At the end of the same year (2006) Lombardi Engineering Ltd, a Swiss engineering company, was selected to design the tunnel and two years later the preliminary studies for the project were completed. The project consists of a 38km-long tunnel from Tarifa to Tangier. Of the 38km, the tunnel would be underwater for 27 kilometers at a maximum depth of 475m and a slope of 3 percent.

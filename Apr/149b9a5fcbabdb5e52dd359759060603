Construction of the US $7.5 bridge started in 2019 and is being implemented by Excel Construction Company. The government funded project is expected to be complete this year and boost the economy in the area. According to Mr Wilberforce Waisana, a resident of Kisiro Trading Centre, prior to the construction of the bridge, travelers from Bulange, Bugobi and Namutumba would connect to Butaleja and Tororo via Budumba Bridge, which is quite expensive. “Many farmers, fishermen and business people are looking forward to the benefits of the bridge because of its strategic location. We have been paying US $2.78 to sail from Kisiro to Butaleja,” Ms Prossy Nabulumba, a tomato vendor in Kisiro Trading Centre,” he said.

Security in Busoga and Bukedi sub-regions will also improve because a police post will be erected near the bridge,” he said.

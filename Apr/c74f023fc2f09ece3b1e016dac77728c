if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-3-0')};The Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company together with the Sudanese Electricity Transmission Company have awarded Siemens Energy a contract to construct two grid stabilization stations in Sudan that will ensure a reliable flow of power from Egypt to Sudan. According to the Germany-based energy technology company, this contract will be the first grid stabilization of scale to be carried out in Sudan and it will utilize Siemens Energy’s Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) technology.

It will also help Egypt to export reliable power to its neighbor, bringing it closer to its goal of becoming a regional power hub. Mahmoud Hanafy, the Vice President of Siemens Energy Transmission Solutions in the Middle East added that the project will support growth, jobs, and economic transformation in the North African countries. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};“We are proud to contribute to this strategic project that is critical to accelerating energy transition and foster power trade in the two North African countries,” concluded Mr. Hanafy. The construction works on the project have already begun and are due to be completed within a 24 months timeframe.

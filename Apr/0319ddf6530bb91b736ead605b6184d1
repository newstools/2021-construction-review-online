Kenya is committed reducing to greenhouse gas emissions by 32% by 2030 and targets 100% clean cooking by 2028, two years ahead of the 2030 UN target. This will be done as part of the efforts by the country to mitigate the effects of climate change. Furthermore, according to president Uhuru Kenyatta, said that the nation plans to make its electricity grid 100% renewable energy, up from the current 90%. “Our geothermal potential is great and the amount currently tapped is less than 10%. This presents huge investments opportunities across the technology value chain as well as huge opportunities for employment,” President Kenyatta said during a virtual climate change address.

Citing the 2020 Adaptation Gap Report issued in mid-January by the United Nations Development Program, the president said that annual adaptation costs in developing countries are estimated at US $70bn, and could reach up to US $300bn in 2030 if no action is taken. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};The president revealed that Kenya’s target is to fully move to renewable energy by the year 2050, and clean energy accounts for approximately 90% of the national electricity supply and will amount to 100% by 2030. He further congratulated US President Joe Biden for showing leadership on environment and climate change issues and for recognising Kenya’s role. He said that climate change, just like Covid-19 was not a future problem but a present one.

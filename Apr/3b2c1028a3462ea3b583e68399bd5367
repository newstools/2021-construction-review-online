The proposed state-of-the-art Mashujaa Museum in Nairobi is set to act as an archive of Kenya’s history since 1800. The museum is currently being developed by the National Museums of Kenya (NMK) in collaboration with other state agencies at Uhuru Gardens, Nairobi County. According to NMK the history to be featured in the museum will span the early history and peoples of Kenya, colonization, independence, warfare, and development over the years. “Key aspects to be considered include the early history and people of Kenya, colonialisation, independence, military history, national growth and development of Kenya after the 2010 constitution,” said NMK.

Inside, the museum will depict the culture and history of Kenya with portraits of heroes such as former President Jomo Kenyatta, Tom Mboya, environmentalist Wangari Maathai and freedom fighter Dedan Kimathi. Portraits and artifacts showing Kenyans’ struggle for independence will also be displayed in various sections. Others include photographs, films, unique literature, writings, maps, traditional weaponry, and musical instruments. Further, in order to appreciate culture, photos of different types of wildlife, primarily the big five, will also be on display. Other sections will include a library, souvenir shop, and a stone artifact showing the first stanza of the national anthem in both English and Swahili. NMK recently appealed to individuals in possession of materials of historical significance to donate to the proposed museum. “We are desirous in acquiring relevant objects/memorabilia by way of donation, a long-term loan, or any other suitable arrangement,” said NMK.

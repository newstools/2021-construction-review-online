This was revealed by the Nigerian Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola. According to the minister, the funds were approved as a result of a request by the project contractor, China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) Construction Company, following material price changes, essentially, between 2012 when the contract was awarded the project, and now. “Materials and costs have changed significantly and also the scope of works of the 85 kilometers section of the road has to be changed now from rehabilitation to reconstruction because its state has worsened compared to when it was awarded 12 years ago,” explained Minister Fashola.

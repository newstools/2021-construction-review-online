The loan was approved by parliament during its recent mid year budget review meeting. The project is expected to commence in March 2022 and will be completed in August 2023. Once done, SRWB will not only be able to supply water to 150 000 people but also be able to meet the demand by 2050.

He further added that, in most cases residents experience dry taps for better part of the day despite efforts to pump water into reservoirs or tanks before supplying them. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Felix Mlusu has justified the decision by government to allow SRWB borrow the money from the EIB. According to him, the loan is very crucial as it will allow the board to carry out such huge projects which will enable people in the two districts access safe and potable water. “This is a soft loan with an interest rate of about 1.5% and will be paid in 20 years with a five year grace period,” he said. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};He further revealed that part of the financial resources will be used for the establishment of a power plant by SRWB hence enabling the institution diversify its operations and increase its revenue.

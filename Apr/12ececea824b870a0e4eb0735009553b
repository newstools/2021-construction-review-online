However, the deadlines were first extended by 12 months from October 2018 to October 2018 and again by 14.5 months from October 2019 to December 2020 and now from December 2020 to October 2021. According to the project contractor, China First Highway Engineering, the latest delay was mainly as a result of delays in the clearance of rights-of-ways for the project and bill payments and partly due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the difficulties encountered during the demolition of rocky masses along the KP 40 and KP 60 and during the construction of earthworks on this same route. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};The project mainly involves the construction of a 60-kilometer 2 x 2-lane freeway, extendable to 3 lanes, from kilometer point 0 to the Bibodi interchange. It also involves the construction of two access roads over a 25-km route. The first access road is a 10-km (2 X 2 lanes) structure through which users can reach KP 00 of the highway from the central post office located at the center of Yaoundé, while the second one will be 13 km long from Bibodi (KP 60) to National Road No. 3 at Boumnyebel. Other works include the building of functional infrastructure such as tolls, weighing stations, rest and service areas as well as emergency lanes.

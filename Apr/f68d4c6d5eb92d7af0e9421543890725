The El Farag gas field currently produces 15,000 barrels per day of condensate and 70 million cubic feet per day of gas. Once the planned second phase development is completed, the field will be able to produce a total of 180 million cubic feet of gas per day.

The effective launch of this second stage of El Farag gas field development should make it possible to increase the North African country’s gas production, and help stimulate the reconstruction of its electrical installations concurrently. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};“This is a very vital, important, and strategic project that will support power plants in this country, and notwithstanding the scarcity of spare parts due to insufficient funding and the country’s political instability in recent years, we will endeavor to operate the second phase soon”, said Nouri Al-Seid, president of WOC. WOC launched the first phase of development of El Farag gas field in November last year after an eight-month time away and operates a set of oil fields in the eastern basin of Sirte.

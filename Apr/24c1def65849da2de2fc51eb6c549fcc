The projects are part of New York State’s first phase of nearly 11,000 MW of clean energy contracted to power the state, enough to power 5 million houses. Among the projects is the first utility-scale solar project in Upstate New York to enter the final phase of construction. These projects will create more than 2,000 jobs and spur nearly US$1.5 billion in private investment to help stimulate the state’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

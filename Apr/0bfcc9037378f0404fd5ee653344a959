This was revealed during a meeting between Angolan President Joao Lourenco and Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi recently. The project is being carried out by a 50-50 joint venture between Italian oil company Eni and national oil company Sonangol (Solenova). The Caraculo Photovoltaic plant construction is located in Namibe Province, in the southwest of the country, known more for its aridity than for its oil resource wealth. According to Eni, phase 1 of the project will be followed by another phase that will allow the solar power plant to have a total capacity of 50MWp. “The implementation of the first phase which will produce 25MWp will reduce diesel consumption by an estimated 13,500 cubic metres per year, reducing electricity production costs and greenhouse gas emissions by about 20,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year,” said the company.

The company expects to carry out such projects in countries where they exploit oil, such as Algeria in North Africa and Ghana in West Africa. In Angola, Eni already supports rural development in Namibe Province. It is a strategic investment that could enable the Italian company to win new oil concessions in the waters of the Namibe basin. The construction of a solar power plant in Namibe province will also support the Angolan government’s plan to move away from “all oil”.

Minister Bekele added that the BO’s, which will provide the release of water into the downstream, have also been tested and they are operational. The 2 BO’s according to the Ethiopian Minister of Water, Irrigation and Energy, have the capacity of passing the entire annual Abbay flow in a year. This he said is an assurance of the flow of water downstream without disruptions. Other 13 such outlets are under construction adding a huge capacity of downstream release.

In its statement, Egypt also added that the second filling process due to unilaterally implemented in mid-July by Ethiopia and seizing a large amount of water which will largely affect the Nile river system, and that the situation will be more complicated starting from the flood season (Next July) as the BOs will release an amount lower than usual in July and August.

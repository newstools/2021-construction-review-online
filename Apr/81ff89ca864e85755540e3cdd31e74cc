South Africaâ€™s Minister of Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation, Ms Lindiwe Sisulu, has commended the progress that has been made towards the upgrade that will revive the plant from its severely deteriorated state. Minister Sisulu visited the facility recently to conduct an inspection at the plant and to have first-hand information on the progress of the ongoing works. Accompanying the Minister during the visit was Executive Mayor of the City of Tshwane (CoT), Councillor Randall Williams and his delegation, and officials from the DWS led by the Gauteng Provincial Head, Mr Sibusiso Mthembu. Minister Sisulu said it was vital for her to visit the facility in order to properly understand the concerns that were raised by the SA Human Rights Commission after the community lodged a complaint with the Chapter 9 institution.

Minister Sisulu said that she was confident that the upgrade being carried out at the Rooiwal Wastewater Treatment Works works is prudent. Some of the work that the Minister was told has been successfully done included the completion of all excavations to the design levels, fully installing two X belt presses and dredging of the maturation dam, as well as supplying chlorine on an ongoing basis.

This agreement and the one that was signed earlier also via video conference, will allow the pre-feasibility studies for this clean energy mega-project to begin. The pre-feasibility studies are estimated to cost around US $1.8m. According to Botswana’s Deputy Permanent Secretary for Mineral Resources, Energy Security and Green Technology, Nchena Mothebe, financial partners joining the project are expected to contribute to the funding of these studies, which will help estimate the overall cost of the mega-project.

Namibia currently imports over 60% of its electricity from South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe to meet the shortfall in domestic generation. For its development, the authorities of the two countries will also benefit from the financial support of the new partners, notably the AfDB, Bird, Power Africa and the IFC, the World Bank subsidiary responsible for financing the private sector. At this stage of the project, the IFC’s involvement means that the solar complex will be open to investment by independent power producers (IPPs).

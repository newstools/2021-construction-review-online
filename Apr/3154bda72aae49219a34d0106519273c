A new ‘Green Stadium’ is set to be built in Nyamira County, Western Kenya. The US $921,658.98 stadium will embrace green energy like use of solar. Nyamira County Governor Amos Nyaribo and County Commissioner Amos Mariba recently led top state delegation, which included ICT and Innovation Principal Secretary Jerome Ochieng, his sports counterpart Joe Okudo and Sports Kenya Chairman Fred Muteti in touring Magwagwa to assess the field where the stadium will be constructed to international standards. According to Fred Muteti, the model in Nyamira will be replicated in other counties. The stadium is a joint project between the national government, Sports Kenya and County government. “This stadium will be of benefit to us all, not just sportsmen and women. We want the green stadium to calculate a healthy living habit in us all by exercising here often. The Nyamira International Stadium in Magwagwa will be our first green stadium in the country,” he said.

It is compatible with Mecalac’s CONNECT hydraulic quick coupler. The thumb is composed of four teeth, it is mounted on the bucket linkage and powered by a cylinder. This handling tool makes it easy to pick up, maintain and move large or long objects. The constant pressure exerted on the thumb throughout the cylinders stroke ensures precise control of the load. This tool has the advantage of being able to stay permanently on the machine, even during digging work, unlike a grappling bucket for example that would have to be dismantled. This option can be ordered from the factory or it is also possible to install it afterwards. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}Learn more about the models: 6MCR and 7MWR About Mecalac if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};Mecalac is an international manufacturer of compact construction equipment for urban sites.

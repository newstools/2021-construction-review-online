According to Governor Salim Mvurya, the oncology centre will ensure early detection, hence saving many lives. “We want to enable early detection through screening. This disease has claimed many lives. Having the facility in our county will also reduce the burden of expenses, which come with treatment,” he said. The centre will provide chemotherapy treatment as well as surgical and laboratory services for patients after the completion of the first phase that will cost US $321,248.28. Completion of the second phase will enable the centre to have a full-fledged oncology department capable of handling all types of cancers and a treatment centre with a capacity of 40 patients.

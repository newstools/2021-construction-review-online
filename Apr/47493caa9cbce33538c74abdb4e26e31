Against the theme, ‘rebooting and repositioning the architectural profession’, this is one of the many intervention programmes that SACAP has been mobilizing in its mission to re-brand the architectural profession in South Africa. According to SACAP President, Mr Charles Nduku: “This Convention not only marks an important milestone in the roadmap towards building relations with stakeholders, but is a new era for architectural professionals. Our goal is to inspire and motivate our professionals to become pioneers in bringing about transformation, diversity, leadership and innovation in the built environment so that architecture plays a more active role in shaping our society to reflect South Africa in all its diversity.” if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};Architectural professionals are innovators, problem solvers and have to wear both the artist and scientist hat. They are undeniably significant custodians of the built environment who play a pivotal role in the overall socio-economic development of South Africa. The 2021 gathering is a call for closer partnership and collaboration between the profession and government in order to achieve the development imperatives of modern South Africa, especially as we undertake recovery efforts and re-imagine our world post Covid-19. The Convention will boast an impressive line-up of industry speakers and will incorporate a number of curated and experiential interventions that will surprise and engage participants. In addition, the programme will offer CPD accreditation, ensuring that participants meet their professional goals. “We are honoured to be joining SACAP on its exciting journey. The SACAP Stakeholder Convention 2021 will not only showcase the talent, skills and enormous contributions that the profession makes to the South African built environment, but is set to shape the future of the profession,” said Devi Paulsen, Vice President of dmg events South Africa. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};SACAP and dmg events will observe all the required protocols which means that in-person participation will be limited to gazetted attendance numbers, anyone planning to attend the live Convention, should ensure they register early to secure their spot so as to avoid disappointment, as space will be limited.

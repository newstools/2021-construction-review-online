According to North Rift region board chairman Maj Gen (rtd) Pastor Awitta, the rehabilitation exercise is already in high gear and construction would take between seven and eight months to be completed. “There will be a lot of activities in this region in the next seven to eight months; the revival of the railway will shorten time used to transport cargo from Mombasa to Malaba and neighbouring countries,” he said. The chairman also revealed that the project would be supervised by a team led by the Uasin Gishu County Commissioner Stephen Kihara during the rehabilitation period.

We are looking forward to the revival of this line because it would transform this region. “We have discussed and agreed that those who have encroached into the railway land be given a little time to harvest their crops. We also want our young people to be involved in the rehabilitation works,” he stated. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_2',117,'0','0']));The Longonot-Eldoret-Malaba MGR rehabilitation project is an addition to various railway lines that have been under rehabilitation in recent months aimed at connecting Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to the Western region.

The members of the National assembly of Niger have approved the bill authorizing the ratification of a financing agreement for the Kandadji dam project that is being implemented approximately 189km northwest of the capital city, Niamey. Particularly, this ratification concerns additional funding of US$ 150M from the International Development Association (IDA) – a member of the World Bank Group that offers concessional loans and grants to the world’s poorest developing countries- for an extension of the project period until 2026. The first stage of construction of the dam at a height of 224m started in March 2019. The second stage of construction of the dam at a height of 228m is expected to start in 2026 and end in 2031 with the filling of the reservoir at a level of 228 m inside Niger and Mali.

Upon completion, the project especially the dam and reservoir will support irrigation of up to 45,000 hectares of land, which will increase agricultural production, boost food security, and improve living conditions downstream. It will also strengthen the country’s energy security through the production of electricity from the hydropower plant, supply clean and safe drinking water to those living nearby, and create jobs by providing opportunities for people to learn and develop new skills and supporting livelihoods. The project is also expected to improve the management of the Niger River. This will consequently enhance environmental flows in the dry season and ensure a reliable municipal water supply for Niamey.

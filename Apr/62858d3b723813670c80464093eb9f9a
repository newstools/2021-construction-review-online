This is after evaluation of the bids submitted in November 2020, of a tender originally launched in March 2020. The 15 MWac Balekane and 15 MWac Ngwenya projects will be located on separate parcels of private land in North Western Eswatini, in the Hhohho region, and connected to the existing Eswatini Electricity Company (EEC) transmission system. Connection works will be undertaken by the Globeleq-Sturdee consortium and once commissioned, the new transmission lines and associated substation equipment will be transferred to the EEC, which will be responsible for their operation and maintenance.

James White and Andrew Johnson, Sturdee Energy’s Executive Directors, also highlighted that these projects will contribute important diversification to Sturdee’s project portfolio and expand its presence in the SADC region. They are also extremely appreciative of the hard work by the Sturdee and Globeleq teams to deliver such strong bids whilst navigating the challenges of COVID-19.

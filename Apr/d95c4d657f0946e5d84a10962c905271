Meredith Management, a premier life sciences real estate development company and local co-developer, has announced its breaking ground on the US$1 billion Fenway Center development, a state-of-the-art life science campus that will anchor a growing life science district between Kenmore Square and the Longwood Medical and Academic Area. The Fenway Center project will be situated on an air rights deck over the Massachusetts Turnpike connecting the Beacon Street and Brookline Avenue bridges at the western gateway to Boston, and it will dramatically improve pedestrian connections between the thriving Longwood Medical Area and the historic Audubon Circle, Fenway, Kenmore Square, Boston University and Back Bay neighborhoods.

It is adjacent to BOWER, a new 312-unit luxury apartment complex that contains 38,000 square feet of amenity-oriented retail, the Lansdowne MBTA Commuter Rail Station, Fenway Park, and the Lansdowne Entertainment District. The project design, which was approved by the City of Boston last year, features more than 960,000 square feet of state-of-the-art life-science buildings with approximately 10,000 square feet of ground-floor retail along Brookline Avenue and Beacon Street, along with an automated garage that will be accessible from both buildings. “Fenway Center creates a direct connection between premier life science, research, academic and medical districts at the gateway to Boston. It also reunites several of Boston’s iconic neighborhoods after more than 100 years of separation caused by railroad tracks and the Mass Pike,” said John Bonanno, Chief Investment Officer of IQHQ. “Fenway Center will be the gateway to the Longwood Medical Center and act as a prominent catalyst for Boston’s rapidly growing life science sector that will serve the needs of future tenants with collaborative workspaces teaming with top talent, and access to world-class entertainment, amenities, residential space, and public transportation.”

The Republic of Chad, a landlocked country in north-central Africa, is set to be home to two new solar power plants with a combined capacity of 30 MW next year. The two power plants are currently being developed in the districts of Lamadji and Gassi, located respectively to the north and south-east of the Central African country’s capital N’Djamena, by Qair. Qair is an Independent Power Producer (IPP) based in France. The company is operating 230 MW of power generation assets exclusively from renewable sources and it is in the construction and financing phase for 930 MW.  Furthermore, it is also developing 3 GW of assets for future deployment in the heart of the 16 territories in which it operates. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}Preliminary studies for the two power plants in Lamadji and Gassi each with a 15MW capacity have already been carried out.

The agreement stipulates that SNE will be buying the facilities production from Qair for a period of 20 years that the latter will be operating the power plants. The construction of these two power plants is part of the Chad government’s policy that aims to diversify its sources and secure its electricity supply. According to authorities using this source of energy, which is more economical than diesel, will in the long term reduce the cost of energy in the Central African country. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};Furthermore, the authorities say the power plants will contribute to achieving the country’s climate objectives, to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 18.2% by 2030 compared to the 2010 level.

Clearway Energy group who will be taking charge of the projects began construction on the 39-MW Mililani I Solar project at Mililani Agricultural Park and the 36-MW Waiawa Solar project in Waiawa which will be paired with 300 MWh of battery storage, with an expected completion date of 2022. The projects were among seven that Hawaiian Electric selected in 2018 through a competitive bidding process to help the state achieve its 100% renewables by 2045 goal. Once the Mililani and Waiawa solar projects are completed, Clearway’s five solar projects totaling 185 MW will generate enough electricity to power more than 45,500 homes a year on Oahu.

According to Clearway, the two projects represent a US$280 million investment and will create more than 460 local union jobs during construction. The completed sites are expected to contribute more than US$10 million in taxes to the city and county. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};“Hawai’i has long led the nation on climate solutions, and we’re honored to continue contributing to that mission with two new renewable energy sites in the state,” said Craig Cornelius, CEO of Clearway. “The addition of solar paired with storage on O’ahu is an important step toward a clean, affordable, and reliable electric grid. We thank Hawaiian Electric, Kamehameha Schools, and many others for their ongoing partnership to advance innovative energy projects and move Hawai‘i toward a carbon-free economy.” “Thanks to Clearway and our partners, we can celebrate this major milestone together as we take another step toward our goal of 100% renewable energy by 2045,” said Governor David Ige.

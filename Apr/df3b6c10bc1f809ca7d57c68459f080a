The launch of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) project, which was planned to take place on 22nd March, 2021, has been deferred to April 2021 due to the very sad and untimely demise of Dr. John Pombe Magufuli, the former President of the United Republic of Tanzania. President Magufuli’s astute leadership set a strong foundation for the EACOP project, with key milestones that included the signing of the Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) in 2017, and the initialling of the Tanzania Host Government Agreement (HGA) in 2020.

In September last year, President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, and his Tanzanian counterpart, John Magufuli, agreed to hasten the implementation of the EACOP project in a bilateral meeting held in Chato District in Geita. This was a follow-up meeting after Uganda signed the Host Government Agreement (HGA) with Total on the multibillion dollar EACOP Project. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};The two leaders urged officials from both countries to expedite the harmonisation of pending issues and fast-track the remaining agreements including the Tanzanian HGA to fasten the implementation of the project. The pipeline will run from Uganda’s oilfields around Lake Albert to the port of Tanga in Tanzania’s northeast region. More than three-quarters of the pipeline will run through Tanzania. Moreover, Tanzania will earn an estimated US$3.24bn and create more than 18,000 jobs over the next 25 years, or more, after the project is in operation.

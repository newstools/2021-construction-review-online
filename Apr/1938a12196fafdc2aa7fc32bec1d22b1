Pfister Energy is in charge of construction on the site and is located on the car and bus parking lots at the shrine. This project is one of the first 45 that was approved by New Jersey BPU under New Jersey’s Community Solar Program Pilot Year 1 in 2019. In addition to the savings to New Jersey residents, the system will also help clean the air and fight climate change. It is expected to offset about 590 tons of carbon emissions annually, the equivalent of taking 128 cars off the road each year. The project is expected to be operational by September 2021 and serves low-and-medium income residents in Warren, Sussex, Hunterdon, and Morris counties that are in First Energy’s service territory.

This comes a month after General Electric Company (GE), an American multinational conglomerate incorporated in New York City and headquartered in Boston, secured an order to supply gas power generation equipment for the project in question. In particular, GE will supply two 9E.03 gas turbines, one STF-A200 steam turbine, three A39 generators, two Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG), and an additional balance of plant equipment as part of the project scope. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','1'])); .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}The facility is expected to begin operations in phases from next year, supporting the Senegalese Government’s target to increase its generation capacity with greater utilization of natural gas and renewables.

It will allow the country to increase its power and move closer to its goal of achieving universal access to energy by 2025. The country recorded a rural electrification rate of 53.9% back in 2019 after giving access to energy to 11% of rural households between 2018 and 2019. The Cap des Biches gas-fired power plant project is fully financed by West African Energy (WAE), a company incorporated by Senegalese shareholders that include Samuel Sarr, the former Senegalese Minister of Petroleum and Energy; Moustapha Ndiaye, the head of the Comptoir commercial Mandiaye Ndiaye (CCMN); Abdoulaye Dia, the boss of the Senegalese industry and trade (Senico); Harouna Dia, a West African investor; and Khadim Bâ, the boss of Locafrique.

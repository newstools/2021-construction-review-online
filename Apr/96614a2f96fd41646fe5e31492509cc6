The plant is expected to reduce the environmental impact of the farm. The solar system floats on one of the farm’s water tanks and is expected to complement an earlier 75kWp installation on the roof of the farm’s buildings, which has been in operation since 2019. According to Ecoligo the two solar photovoltaic systems will allow the farm to avoid 136 tonnes of CO2 emissions per year. “The grid-connected installations also reduce the farm’s dependence on electricity supplied by the state-owned Kenya Power, as they now cover 60% of its needs. The new technology also reduces Rift Valley Roses’ electricity bills,” said the company.

The company said that private investors have the opportunity to put their money into sustainable projects, do something good for the environment and even profit from it with a return of up to 7% per year. The solarisation of the Rift Valley Roses farm is supported by the Renewable Energy Solutions programme. Coordinated by the German energy agency Deutsche Energie-Agentur (Dena), the programme aims to support companies in the acquisition and installation of renewable energy technologies. The programme is also supported by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy through the German Energy Solutions Initiative. This other initiative supports the adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency solutions.

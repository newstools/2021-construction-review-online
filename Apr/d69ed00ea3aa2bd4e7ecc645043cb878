NELSAP is one of the investment programs under the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI)  mandated to facilitate transformative regional transboundary cooperative projects or/and in-country projects with regional impact related to the common use of the Nile Basin water resources. It focuses on hydropower investment projects and regional power transmission interconnections as well as water resources management and development projects. Power Sharing The project is a joint development by the Governments of Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania through a commonly owned, Rusumo Power Company (RPCL). if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};The predicted annual generation is approximately 500GWhr with a load factor of 63%. The generated electricity will be equally shared among the three countries each benefiting from approximately 26MW directly connected to the national grid through 220kV transmission lines from Rusumo Falls to; 1. Gitega in Burundi (161km), 2. Nyakanazi in Tanzania (98km) and 3. Shango and Bugesera in Rwanda (119km).

By so doing, the project will have addressed the acute shortage of electricity experienced by the three Kagera sub-region countries of Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania which is negatively affecting their economies and the livelihoods of their citizens. The project will also enhance regional cooperation, peacebuilding, support the sustainable management of the Kagera river basin, and promote growth and poverty reduction whilst managing environmental aspects.

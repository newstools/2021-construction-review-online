The company is expected to upgrade the 196km long highway to all-weather gravel standards, within a period of 36 months. The Lamu-Ijara-Garissa highway project is part of the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor project and consists of spur roads associated with the highway. It is the first part of a US $228m road construction project that the state is expected to undertake in Lamu County stretching 250km.

He further added that the Hindi-Kiunga road which is expected to serve as the main tarmacked road connecting Kenya to Somalia via Lamu, will aid in improving cross border trade relations with Somalia once diplomatic tensions are settled. “Initially gravel works, and clearing of the two road corridors will be done and we expect works to begin in April this year,” he revealed. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};Currently the banditry prone Hindi-Kiunga road is in a state of disrepair and local leaders have been lobbying the national government to upgrade and tarmac it. Regrettably due to its condition, the road has been a common target for Al-Shabaab militants who implant IEDs on it.

As part of this year’s Earth Day celebration, the companies came together to support the project that is already under construction in Denton County, Texas. Noble consists of 275 MW of solar and 125-megawatt hours MW of battery storage. The Home Depot and NRG have each executed individual 100 MW solar PPAs, and The Hershey Company has contracted for a 50 MW solar PPA. Using the United States’ Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator, Noble is estimated to offset carbon dioxide emissions by 450,000 metric tons annually during the first 20 years of operation and will support the clean energy goals of The Home Depot, NRG, and The Hershey Company.

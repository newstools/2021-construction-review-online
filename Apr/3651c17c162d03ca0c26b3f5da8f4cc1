A new mixed-income apartment complex at Bartlett Station in Roxbury, Boston has begun. The complex will have 60 units that will conclude the first phase of the five-phase redevelopment of the former MBTA Bartlett Bus Yard in Nubian Square. The 60 new apartments currently being constructed at Bartlett Station Building A will join a 60-unit, mixed-income rental apartment building and a 16-unit condominium building that was completed on the site in August 2019. The non-profit Nuestra Comunidad Development Corporation and Windale Developers, Inc. are partnering to redevelop the formerly vacant, eight-acre brownfield site into approximately 380 new homes for working families, including 166 homes for purchase, 214 apartments and 30,000 square feet of commercial space. The transformation of the former bus yard will occur over five phases. The development project is anticipated to generate approximately 100 retail jobs and 900 construction jobs, with 60 percent of the jobs going to workers of color.

According to Mashonaland West Provincial Development Coordinator (PDC) Mr Josphat Jaji, completion of the first phase, which was launched by President Mnangagwa in August 2019 is now complete but the constructor is still on the ground. “This in line with conditions of the contract that they will maintain the Makuti-Chirundu Road for a year before it is left to the Department of Roads,” he said. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_2',117,'0','0']));The impressive workmanship has been hailed by motorists who called for expansion of the project to cover other parts that are now pothole riddled. Mr John Kasembo from the DRC said that the project is a welcome development which will give a better driving experience for across borders motorists “It was painful to see some of our colleagues dying on the road especially at Marongora where the curves were too sharp making it difficult for trucks to navigate,” he added.

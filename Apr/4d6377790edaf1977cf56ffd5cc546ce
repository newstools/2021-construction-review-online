Nearly 15 years ago, the Texarkana Airport Authority began talks about the possibility of building a new passenger terminal. This year, those plans are finally taking off with the new update of the airport constructed in the 1960s. The airport is receiving a large amount of federal funds to build the new taxiway and passenger terminal. Both sides of the city will be responsible for about 10 percent or nearly US$4 million of the project.

The final phase of construction is expected to be completed in the fall of 2024. Right now, American Airlines is the airport’s only commercial airline. The air passenger carrier offers three flights a day to Dallas – Fort Worth. This year, the airport is celebrating its 90th anniversary in commercial operations. Paul Mehrlich, the Texarkana Regional Airport director said the new terminal could potentially house up to four airlines. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}He said another advantage of the new terminal will be the airport’s access from Interstate 49. The new terminal will be built near the airport’s Public Safety Center. That means travelers will no longer have to cross over these railroad tracks along Highway 67. “We can expect the new building will be around for about 50 years. We wanted to future-proof it and allow us to expand, bring in large aircraft and larger airlines as our community changes and grows as well. Anytime a city has a robust airport. They’ll also be adding a lot to their local economy.” The director added.

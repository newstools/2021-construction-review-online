The automotive company is partnering with Dezer Development for the project, which will be the British manufacturer’s first-ever luxury residential tower.  Dezer Development has partnered with Armani/Casa and Porsche towers and is no stranger to luxury developments. Sieger Suarez also collaborated with Dezer for both of the previous projects and will also be overseeing the design of the new Bentley construction. Each of the 200-plus apartments will have an in-unit, multi-car garage, so your prized marque can be stored in your very own residence. A patented car elevator will transport your car up to whatever residence you’re in.

If you do want to meet others, though, there’s a gym, a spa, a restaurant, a whisky bar, and a landscaped communal garden. The 60-story tower is being developed with the Florida Green Building Council (FLGC) certification to help protect local wildlife like the endangered sea turtles that nest nearby. That will mean environmentally-friendly building materials and construction designed to reduce coastal lighting, a particular concern for the turtles. Construction is set to begin in 2023 with a projected completion date of 2026. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}“Partnering with Bentley Motors, a truly global luxury brand, and being able to create another first in the Miami marketplace is an extraordinary opportunity,” said Gil Dezer, president of Dezer Development. “With Bentley Motors, together we will create something inspiring, powerful, and iconic – a true game-changer when it comes to luxury living.

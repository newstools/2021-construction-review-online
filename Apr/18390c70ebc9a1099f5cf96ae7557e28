Water woes have persisted in Harare and the council chose to be quiet for a long time, further worsening the water situation. Last year, Harare supplied 380 mega litres of water per day to its residents and this year they are supplying 442 mega litres, but after the refurbishments the local authority is targeting 614 mega litres per day. Minister Chidau said the provision of water was a key component of the government’s agenda to ensure good service delivery and improve the general standard of living in Harare and Zimbabwe at large.

Keller is the largest specialist Geotechnical Company with solutions for Ground Improvement, Deep Foundations, Grouting and Earth Retention, “explains Dulce Simoes, Marketing Manager BU Middle East Africa. Global strength and local focus are what makes us unique. Our knowledge of local markets and ground conditions means we’re ideally placed to understand and respond to a particular local engineering challenge. Our global knowledge base then allows us to tap into a wealth of experience, and the brightest minds in the industry, to find the optimum solution. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1','ezslot_8',612,'0','0']));Used alone or in combination, the firm’s techniques solve a wide range of challenges across the entire construction sector – from industrial, commercial and housing projects to infrastructure construction for dams, tunnels, transportation and water treatment, as well as projects to address environmental challenges.

By connecting global resources and local knowledge, the firm can tackle some of the largest and most demanding projects around the world but the everyday work they do is just as important. Speaking on potential clients Simoes concludes as he advises them,  “If you intend to operate in Africa, set up the company correctly in each country with the aim to employ local people who know the country and its laws. Each African country operates slightly differently. Never under estimate the value of a decent site investigation before embarking on any geotechnical work.” eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'constructionreviewonline_com-leader-1','ezslot_9',614,'0','0']));

Construction of the Julius Nyerere Hydropower Station; the largest in the East African Community (EAC) has reached 45%. The US $2.9bn project is expected to add 2,115MW into the national grid. The US $2.9bn hydropower station project is being constructed across the Rufiji River in eastern Tanzania. The station is expected to produce 5,920GWh of power annually. The power generated will be evacuated via a new 400kV high voltage power line to a substation where the power will be integrated into the national electricity grid. The government of Ethiopia is advising the Tanzanian government on the implementation of this project. The project is expected to enhance access to affordable electricity which will propel economic growth as well as attract investment in the country. It will also transform the country through generation and supply of reliable electricity for both domestic and industrial use. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}The project which is being undertaken by Arab Contractors and Elsewedy Electric is owned and will be managed by the government owned Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO).

The 134 metres (440 ft) arched, concrete dam is expected to create a reservoir lake, 100 kilometres (62 mi), in length, measuring 1,200 square kilometres (460 sq mi), with 34,000,000,000 cubic metres (1.2×1012 cu ft) of water. In April 2019, the Tanzanian government made an upfront payment of about US $309m, taking care of approximately 15% total cost of construction. Construction of the largest hydropower station in EAC is expected to be complete in 2022.

A statement issued by the Communications and Public Outreach Unit of MiDA in Accra said that Messrs GHS Housing Limited of Ghana was undertaking the construction of the building that will house the test laboratory. The building is almost complete and the installation of the test equipment is expected to be completed in July, this year.

It will also support the National Appliance Standards and Labelling Systems Program that is spearheaded by the Energy Commission. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};These vital services will consequently contribute to the efficient use of electricity in the West African country. The construction of this Laboratory is a part of the Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management (EEDSM) Project of the Ghana Power Compact, procured at a cost of US$ 1.95M under the US$ 308M grant funds made available to Ghana by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), an independent U.S. Government foreign aid agency that is helping lead the fight against global poverty.

The NMS Director for Roads Engineer Michael Ochieng who was on-site to supervise the test run said they are putting final touches on the park ahead of the official launch next month. According to Ochieng the test will help identify the loopholes, which will be sealed before the launch. The move is aimed at decongesting the city streets by implementing the gradual removal of PSVs from the Central Business District. The new terminus will act as the drop-off and pick-up point for PSVs plying Ngong and Lang’ata routes with a capacity of 300 vehicles at a go. Non-Motorised Transport (NMT) system in place offers options for cyclists and pedestrians to access CBD, the walk ways and cycle ways are extended outside the terminus.

Instead, Badi announced in late January 2021 that the terminus will now be ready in February 2021 when it will be officially opened for use by the transport stakeholders. This is yet to materialize as we approach the end of April 2021.

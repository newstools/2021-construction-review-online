The California bullet train project has announced that they are expecting the date of completion to be pushed to at least April of 2025 for the 65-mile section of the line in Kings County, nearly two years after the date the state included in a business plan adopted last week. It’s yet another setback for the project that’s been mired in pushed deadlines and cost overruns for a project that voters in 2008 approved; a bond for the rail line, eventually aimed at connecting Los Angeles to San Francisco.

A letter from a construction team headed by the Spanish firm Dragados notifying the California High-Speed Rail Authority of the latest delay for the planned bullet train stated a complaint that the rail authority’s failure to accurately predict land acquisition has tangled construction schedules and caused fitful conditions along the route. Dragados said it has had to hire workers as land becomes available and then lay them off as it awaits new parcels. It said that “trepidation” among subcontractors and suppliers is resulting in a higher risk that must be priced into bids for work. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}Joe Hedges, the chief operating officer at the rail authority, downplayed the letter in an interview with a local newspaper. He called it part of a back-and-forth bargaining process normal in the construction industry. The completion date of 2025 is subject to negotiation and the delays can be mitigated, he said. The chief operating officer also disputed Dragados’ complaints about faulty state land forecasts. Land acquisition has been a monumental hurdle for the project since 2012. In Kings County, the rail authority still needs 264 more parcels, but in January it acquired only nine. At that rate of progress, it would take 2½ years just to buy the land.

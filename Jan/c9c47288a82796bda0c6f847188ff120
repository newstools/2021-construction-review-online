The president of Tanzania Dr. John Magufuli has the foundation stone at the International Vocational Education Training Centre (VETA) project, at Nyakato Ward, in Bukoba municipality. According to the government’s initiative of building more Vocational Education Training Centres (VETA) is aimed at supporting the country’s industrialisation drive. The sufficient number of vocational training colleges across the country, will be able to feed all the factories with skilled and competent labour force. The US $9.5m centre will be able to accommodate between 800 and 1,000 students pursuing long and short courses, a move that would complement the government’s industrialisation drive.

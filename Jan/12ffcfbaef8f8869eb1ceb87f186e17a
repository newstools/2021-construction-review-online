According to Marsa Maroc, the main operator of ports in the North African country, the container terminal was officially opened at the beginning of this month. Marsa Maroc is one of the owners of the Marsa International Tangier Terminals SA (MINTT) consortium that was in charge of the realization, construction, and management of the container with a 50% stake.  The co-owners are Contship Italia Group, an Italian container terminal, intermodal & logistics operator, and Eurogate international, with a combined stake of 40%, as well as Hapag Llyod, a German international shipping and container transportation company with a 10% stake.

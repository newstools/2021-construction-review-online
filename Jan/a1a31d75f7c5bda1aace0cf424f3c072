The announcement came following the conclusion of a dynamic load testing exercise, during which four dump trucks weighing 30 tonnes each were placed on the bridge that connects Kayunga and Kamuli districts across River Nile.

After seven hours of testing, Mr. Pario said: “The Bridge has passed the test and we shall now recommend to the relevant authorities that it is ready for commissioning. Meanwhile, pedestrians and motorcyclists are free to use it to cross through the river. Vehicles will be allowed after its commissioning.” eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_4',117,'0','0']));Built by China International Water and Electric Corporation, the bridge is expected to boost trade between Kayunga and Kamuli districts and create an alternative route for travelers traveling to and from the eastern region. The travelers have been relying on a ferry that docks about three kilometers from the bridge, and which has been an inconvenience due to its unreliable travel schedules. Mr. Pario said that the ferry would be relocated to another site yet to be determined by the government of the East African country. There are also plans to turn the bridge into a tourism site to increase local revenue for Kayunga District. President Yoweri Museveni is expected to commission the bridge together with the newly renovated and expanded Kayunga district hospital soon.

Construction work is set to resume on the CityGate project, integrated community development in New Cairo, approximately 30km southeast of Cairo, the capital city of Egypt. This is after the project’s developer, Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company, a real estate property investment, development, and management company headquartered northeast of Doha on the coast of the Arabian Gulf, obtained approval from the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA), an Egyptian government authority affiliated with the Ministry of Housing and which is in charge of urban development in the North African country, to work on the CityGate project, which has been suspended since 2016 following a dispute between the Qatari real estate company and NUCA. East Gate Developments (East Gate), a subsidiary of Qatari Diar has since requested a license to resume working on the project and it is currently communicating with local contractors in preparation for the resumption of the construction works. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));CityGate is an integrated community with the tranquility of nature, green spaces, and amenities distributed in a well-planned space in an iconic marvelous location in New Cairo.

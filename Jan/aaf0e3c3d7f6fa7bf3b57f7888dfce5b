Green hydrogen is receiving a lot of attention as it could be a promising source of energy in the near future. For example, a ministerial committee is currently working on the national level to study hydrogen, research all possible alternatives for the generation and use of hydrogen taking into account international experiences in this field. Energy Strategy 2035 will also be updated to include green hydrogen as an energy source.

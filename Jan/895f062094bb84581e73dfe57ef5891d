Also, 40 kilometers has been completed under section two which is Kaduna-Zaria, and 70 kilometers completed under section three from Zaria-Kano,” he explained. He also stated that while some sections of the road were also at different levels of completion, remedial works were being carried out on the sections that were critically bad in order to facilitate movement. The Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Road forms a critical part of the West African country road network, enabling the movement of people and products from the North to the South and vice versa – thereby uniting the Nigerian people and economy, and connecting Nigeria to North Africa via the Lagos-Algiers Trans-African Highway. The Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano road reconstruction project was awarded to Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, a leading Nigerian company offering integrated construction solutions and related services, on December 20, 2017. The project commenced on May 21, the following year with 36 months completion period.

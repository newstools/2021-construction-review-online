Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa Kassim on 2nd July 2017. The launching of TARURA followed an announcement in the National Gazette with GN 211 of 12nd May 2017. The Prime Minister directed the TARURA  to kick out rampant corruption that prevails in tender processes, especially for road projects. “Only capable contractors should be hired to execute road projects through competitive tendering,” remarked the Premier. He also ordered TARURA to address poor supervision of construction contracts between contractors and authorities in road projects, emphasizing on transparency in all contracts for public works. Mr. Majaliwa warned some district council leaders whom he accused of re-channeling funds allocated for roadworks to other projects, reiterating that funds should be used as per the planned projects. He said that TARURA would facilitate improvements of rural and urban road networks, enabling people to transport crops and other items from rural to urban areas.

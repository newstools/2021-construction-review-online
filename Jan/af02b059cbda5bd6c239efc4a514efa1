Construction works at New Administrative Capital’s (NAC’s) Central Business District (CBD) in Egypt are about to be finalized. According to Housing Minister Essam el Gazzar, 53 floors of the Iconic Tower, Africa’s Tallest Building, have been finalized and fronts of other towers are currently under construction in the Central Business District (CBD) at the New Administrative Capital. Meanwhile, the construction of the third residential district, Capital Residence, is also underway, with 90% of the district finished. Capital Residence is built on an area of 1,016 acres and includes eight neighborhoods, with a total of 24,130 housing units. Another district named “New Garden City”, is 82% complete. The district includes 295 residential buildings, 105 villas, 175 townhouses, 11 towers, and 96 mixed housing buildings. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',115,'0','0']));Minister Gazzar also confirmed that the Cairo Capital Central Park project will cover an area of one thousand acres, making it one of the largest parks in the world.

The Chinese were to build a new parliament complex, 12 ministerial buildings, a convention center and an exhibition area at what is believed would be a whooping US $45bn. This would undoubtedly form the nucleus from which the rest of the city would grow as demand for other amenities such as housing and shopping would stem. With a total area of 1,900,000 square meters, the Central Business District (CBD) consists of 20 buildings, including 12 high-rise office buildings, five high-rise apartment buildings, two luxury hotels, and a 385.8m tall Iconic Tower, which will be the tallest in Africa. The whole project is scheduled to be delivered by 2022.

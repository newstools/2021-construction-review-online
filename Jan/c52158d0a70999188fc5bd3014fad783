The 4,600m2 Inland Storage Facility will be situated approximately 10 kilometers from the Freeport of Monrovia. It will be powered by a rooftop solar-hybrid system with rooftop solar photovoltaic panels, smart switches, and monitoring systems, whose supply and installation capital was provided by PIDG’s Technical Assistance (PIDG TA), following a pre-feasibility study to assess the power needs of the facility.

It is anticipated that the system will provide a replicable model for similar facilities in the region, with the potential to drive down carbon emissions in the entire sector. Upon completion, the facility will allow businesses to optimize their supply chains, minimizing stock wastage and damage which should ultimately reduce overall costs to the end consumers. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_4',117,'0','0']));“The LISF will provide businesses of all sizes from Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to larger companies within the Mano River Union with access to the much-needed storage and sophisticated warehouse management systems, enabling them to drive efficiencies and grow their businesses,” explained Gilles J. Vaes the Chief Executive Officer at InfraCo Africa. The LISF’s flexible design will allow for the inclusion of alternative storage solutions in the future, such as temperature-controlled capacity for the storage of food and pharmaceutical products, to meet the evolving needs of Liberia’s businesses.

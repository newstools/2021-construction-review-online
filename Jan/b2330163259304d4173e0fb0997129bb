It also features two display cases that contain Canopic jars and other objects imitating religious rituals in Ancient Egypt. The display system uses modern technology, as the exhibition halls are equipped with screens displaying an interactive panoramic film depicting history. It also features an illustration of each of the ancient Egyptian capitals, including its architecture, religious buildings, and most famous landmarks.

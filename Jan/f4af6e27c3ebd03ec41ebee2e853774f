Kenya has committed to meeting a growing demand for electricity with 100% renewable generation, in order to bring down both national emissions and electricity costs. LTWP’s flagship 310MW wind farm has been sited in a region with consistently strong, unidirectional winds. With the wind farm now operational, LTWP has turned its focus on ensuring that the wind farm is able to take full advantage of this optimal resource, and, ultimately deliver consistent, high yield returns for its investors.

Through its machine learning-driven analysis, Clir will be able to see through the ‘noise’ of resource fluctuation and identify any instances of underperformance and their causes, providing LTWP with the insights necessary to increase annual energy production, monitor asset health and manage technical financial risk. Clir’s team will further use this analysis to compare individual asset performance at a project, portfolio, and industry level, with insights shared with all project stakeholders via Clir’s reporting function. According to David O’Hare, Director, Clir, Europe, Lake Turkana is a particularly unique project it is the first of this scale in Africa and has been developed to take advantage of some of the best conditions for consistent energy production. “Having worked across a number of large-scale, unique projects around the world, we are keen to leverage our wide-ranging experience to assess Lake Turkana’s current performance and potential gains. “We are delighted to provide access to our industry-leading analytics and the team’s global expertise in support of LTWP as it realizes the full potential of this project and the region’s incredible resource, both in terms of energy generation and resulting returns,” he said. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_4',117,'0','0']));Wellington Otieno, Chief Technical Officer, LTWP said that they are committed to making sure this project produces beyond our expectations. “With Clir, our team of local technicians will be supported with the most up-to-date digital tools and analytics to target operations and maintenance and cut unnecessary asset downtime. With our turbines performing at their best, we will be in a position to supply Kenya with consistent, low-priced, green energy,” he affirmed.

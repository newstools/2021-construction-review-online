The Australian mining company has already signed a a public-private partnership (PPP) agreement with Solar Century to implement the project on a build, own, operate, transfer method. Solar Century will also provide the installation with an 8.5MWh battery-based electricity storage system which will supply electricity to the graphite mine, hence boosting supply to its facilities. Apart from reducing the project’s power costs, the solar-hybrid system is expected to reduce Carbon dioxide emissions significantly. According to Shaun Verner, Managing Director and CEO of Syrah Resources, the future solar hybrid power plant will reinforce the existing 15MW Balama power plant which is running on diesel, comprised of seven 2.2MW generators. “It would also help reduce the greenhouse gases emitted by the mining company Syrah Resources in Mozambique, one of the countries most affected by climate change in Africa,” he added.

Balama’s 50+ year mine life, and high reserve grade (16% total graphitic carbon) will enable the Company to participation in the long term growth of the electric vehicle industry. The plant has a capacity of 2Mtpa ore throughput, 350ktpa graphite concentrate, which is mined through conventional means that include crushing, grinding, flotation, filtration, drying, screening and bagging. Water for Balama is supplied from the Chipembe Dam which has a capacity of approximately 25 million m3 and is located 12km away. The project has facilities that include Medical and Emergency Response Centers, Accommodation Village and a Canteen.

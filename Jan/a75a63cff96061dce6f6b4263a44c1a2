It comes following the water drilling project that the mission carried out in the same region in 2018. Insanatane Ag Rousmane, from the Security Sector Reform and Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Section (SSR/DDR) of the Minusma explained that it is their concern to finance these projects so as to improve the conditions of access to water for the population and livestock while reducing community conflicts related to water and grazing. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_4',117,'0','0']));This program is also supported by the United Kingdom through the United Nations Trust Fund for Peace and Security in Mali. The Kidal region climate is characterized by temperatures that can reach up to 45°C during the day and scarce and low rainfall. In order to capture groundwater in this region, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Kidal, it is sometimes necessary to dig wells up to 70 meters deep and boreholes up to 130 meters deep.

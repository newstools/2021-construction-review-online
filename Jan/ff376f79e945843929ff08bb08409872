Holcomb announced that nearly US$173 million from federal-state funding was allocated to allow for the construction of the expansion of the South Shore double track rail project, a project that has been a decades-long priority for the region. The US$491 million South Shore Indiana project, which is a key segment of Gov. Holcomb’s Next Level Agenda, will speed-up the passenger rail service between Gary and Michigan City as well as make critical safety improvements at grade crossings and platform improvements at five stations. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and the Northern Indiana Commuter Transportation District (NICTD) signed the Full Funding Grant Agreement. This agreement finalizes the full federal funding for the project through the FTA’s Capital Investment Grant (CIG).

The Double Track project would take trains off the roadway and close 21 at-grade crossings. A new parking structure and raised platform would be put in place helping to cut down the time it takes to travel between Michigan City and Chicago. The heart of the project calls for laying 41 kilometers of new track between Michigan City and Gary. Currently, there is only one track in place there right now and it carries two-way traffic. Double Track would allow west and eastbound trains to safely pass. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0']));“By improving commuter rail through the region, the project is a game-changer for northwest Indiana and the entire state,” Holcomb said. “Combined with our recent announcement on the West Lake Corridor project, double-tracking the South Shore line will connect Hoosiers, attract talent and business, and increase the quality of life in our great Indiana communities.”  FTA Deputy Administrator K. Jane Williams stated that “Commuters on the South Shore Line can look forward to more efficient commuter rail service connecting them to downtown Chicago while supporting economic recovery.”

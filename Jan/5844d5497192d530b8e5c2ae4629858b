These funds are expected to enable the Essor A2E project to get off the ground, particularly, they will enable the first phase of the project to be launched.  This phase will be followed by a second phase that will replicate the proven system for increasing investment in the off-grid sector. eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_3',117,'0','0']));The African Development Bank (AfDB), which is supporting the project, emphasized that the three solar power plants will each have an installed capacity of between 3 and 10 megawatts. The objective of the entire project, which requires an investment of US$ 100m, is to reach thousands of “dispersed consumers” across the three cities: or approximately 21,200 households and 2,100 Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and public buildings during the first five years of the project’s implementation.

Located within the Boké and Kindia regions in Guinea’s northwest region, the 135 km Dapilon-Santou railway is meant Santou mining zone and the port of Dapilon. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_3',117,'0','0']));The entirety of the railway, designed by China Railway First Survey and Design Institute Group Co. (FSDI) and built by China Railway 18th Bureau Group both of which are subsidiaries of the State-owned China Railway Construction Corp Ltd, will feature 23 bridges, 2 tunnels, and 6 depots. During its early and near-future phases, the railway will be primarily tasked with the transport of mineral rocks (ore and bauxite) from the mining zone to Dapilon Harbor. While Guinea is one of the world’s largest exporter of bauxite, the railway project will further consolidate and strengthen the country’s position on the global bauxite market. In the future, it is expected that the line will be opened to serve third-parties and to be integrated into the Guinean national railway network to better serve the country’s socio-economic development.

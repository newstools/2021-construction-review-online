The construction works were carried out by China Geo-engineering cooperation (CGC), a Chinese construction company involved in the construction of hydropower plants, electric power projects, agricultural irrigation works, water supply, house building, and road projects among others. This step marks the completion of Component 1 of the Irrigation Development Programme in the Bani Basin and Sélingué (PDI-BS), a government initiative that is entirely financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB) to the tune of about US$ 25m. Eventually, the PDI-BS will have an impact on nearly 12,000 farms, that’s approximately 130,000 people in the intervention zones of Sélingué, Bla/San, and Djenné. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));The Kourouba dam, according to Malian authorities, will boost the activities of farmers, stockbreeders, and fishermen, consequently increasing their income and reduce poverty.

The Kourouba dam will also contribute to the improvement of access to electricity. It will be integrated into a power plant (Kourouba hydropower plant), which is equipped with 12 VLH turbines totalizing an installed capacity of 3.9 MW. The power plant will eventually bring energy to about 20.000 people in the Kourouba region.

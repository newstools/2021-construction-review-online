The rehabilitation of the Nanyuki Airstrip in Laikipia County is in top gear with the completion of a 1.5km runway and two aprons expected in October this year. Works at the busy airstrip had stalled after the contractor who had initially been awarded the contract was unable to deliver forcing the Government to award the tender to another contractor. The Nanyuki Airstrip is currently undergoing rehabilitation to enable it accommodate bigger planes with a carrying capacity of up to 52 passengers. Currently, the airstrip can only accommodate planes with a capacity of 14 passengers. The US $2.7m upgrade will be expected to improve tourism and trade in the region. The Airstrip is expected to rival WilsonÂ and Ukunda Airports in terms of domestic flights since Laikipia County is a major tourist destination. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));According to David Kyule, Nanyuki Airstrip Manager, engineers in the Airstrip have assembled four planes so far including an Airbus helicopter owned by Tropic Air.

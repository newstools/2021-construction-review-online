This is according to the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water, simply known as ONEE. “The construction works of this wind farm have been accomplished and the assembly rate of the wind turbines has been upheld despite a health context marked by the Covid-19 pandemic,” said the ONEE in a statement. The Midelt wind farm, with a capacity of 210 megawatts, is located 8 kilometers northeast of the city of Midelt and it extends over an area of 2,300 hectares. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0']));The project was carried out by a consortium formed by Enel Green Power, an Italian multinational renewable energy corporation, headquartered in Rome, and Nareva Holding, an energy company in Morocco wholly owned by the Société Nationale d’Investissement (SNI) (National Investment Company) or Al Mada, as well as ONEE, the pillar of the energy strategy and the armed wing of the State in the water and sanitation sector in Morocco.

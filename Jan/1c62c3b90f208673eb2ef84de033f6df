The consortium has strongly contributed to the success of the construction project of the 127 MW Maria-Gléta 1 thermal power plant which was inaugurated by Benin’s energy minister, Dona Jean-Claude Houssou, in September 2019. The decision to hire the consortium for the second phase was reached in a bid to capitalize on the experience and reduce the timeframe for the completion of the project, based on the expertise, technicality, and thoroughness it has shown.

It runs on seven gensets from Germany’s MAN Energy Solutions, a multinational company that produces large-bore diesel engines and turbomachinery for marine and stationary applications, like marine propulsion systems, power plant applications, and turbochargers, and which built the plant in a consortium with Denmark’s Burmeister & Wain Scandinavian Contractor (BWSC), a global turnkey developer, contractor, and operator of custom specific engine-based and boiler-based power plants. The plant, which increased Benin’s capacity for electricity generation by more than 50%, was part of the government’s ‘Revealing Benin’ action plan, which centers around 45 flagship projects aimed at strengthening macroeconomic development, consolidating democracy, and improving the lives of the population.

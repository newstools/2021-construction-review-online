Established in 1993, they offer a series of machines and equipment for concrete treatment, which complement the well-known products for soil and asphalt compaction. Certified according to ISO 9001 and 14001, they offer a wide range of products with various engine options and sizes for different applications. Their models are versatile and easy to operate guaranteeing durability and versatility resulting in lower operational and maintenance costs. Their soil compactors can be driven very slowly because of their infinitely variable speed control and in the case of asphalt compaction their machines are fitted with a built-in water tank and sprinkler to cool/lubricate the base plate preventing hot asphalt from sticking to the plate. The machinery base plate is specially designed to prevent track formation on the surface in asphalt work. Their soil compactors have a hot-dip galvanization coating. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_6',115,'0','1']));They offer the following machinery for soil compaction: Reversible vibratory plates, forward vibratory plates for asphalt, forward vibratory plates for gravel and tampers. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_2',117,'0','0']));Their extensive experience and knowledge of various applications and of how concrete products are being used at construction sites is the foundation of Swepacs’ product  development. This helps achieve the best performance for their products and constructions.

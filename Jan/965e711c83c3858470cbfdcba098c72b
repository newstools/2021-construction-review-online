The first test-run has been successfully conducted by Alstom SA, a French multinational rolling stock manufacturer, running 2 km from the secondary storage park T2 section to SNTF station. Mr. Amar Chouaki, the managing director for Alstom Algeria said that they were pleased to have achieved this significant milestone despite various challenges including the Covid-19 pandemic. “The next steps will be the rigorous dynamic tests to ensure smooth running and guarantee maximum safety for both passengers and the operator” explained the Chouaki. The 14.5km Mostaganem Tramway project consists of two lines and 24 stations. The first line (north-south Line T1) will connect Salamander Place in the north to the University of Kharouba in the south, serving 19 stations.

The project however missed the set completion date due to flooding, subsidence and Isolux Corsán’s severe financial difficulties, and was subsequently restarted through a consortium of Alstom and the Cosider Group, Algeria. The Algerian Minister of Transport, Lazhar Hani, during the first test run, affirmed that the Mostaganem tramway will enter commercial operation in the first semester of this year. The network will be operated using a fleet of 25 Citadis 402 43.9m-long LRVs, which will be manufactured by Cital, a joint venture of Alstom, EMA, and Ferrovial, Spain.

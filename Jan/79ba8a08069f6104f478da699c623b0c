Tema LNG Terminal Company (TLTC), the owner of Tema LNG Terminal (a Liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal under construction in Accra, Ghana) has received a regasification unit (RU) for its project which also comprises floating storage. Built by Jiangnan Shipbuilding, a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding Corporation, the RU will be located within Tema Port, where TLTC has constructed additional marine infrastructure that will allow for cost-efficient LNG loading and regasification without affecting maritime and port traffic in the Gulf of Guinea. Liquefied natural gas will be supplied under a long-term contract with Shell. The onshore reception facilities will receive the gas from the RU via subsea pipelines, before delivering natural gas to the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation and its customers.

This system provides Ghana with all the functionality of a large scale FRU-terminal, but with added flexibility, allowing it to respond to rapidly increasing domestic gas demand with a cleaner and more affordable energy solution. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_2',117,'0','0']));Also, Spain’s LNG terminal operator, Reganosa, has been awarded the contract to operate and maintain the 2.34 billion cubic meter/year Tema LNG regasification terminal in Ghana.

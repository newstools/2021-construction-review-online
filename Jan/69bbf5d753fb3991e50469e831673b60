The level of completion of the project is around 90%. All the major brick work has been done and we are left with two major deliverables, which include cleaning up the intersection and signalization. There are four synchronized signalization we are expecting to have and each must work together with the other. We are expecting that all these will be done in early January. This is in fulfilment of the promise we made that we will complete all projects abandoned. We are giving the contractor handling this project a maximum of eight weeks to attend to little snags in the project,” said the governor in the presence of his Deputy, Obafemi Hamzat, and other cabinet members who had accompanied him to the inspection. He further expressed his satisfaction with the quality of work done, adding that the 1.7km-long bridge will be available for public use as early as February. “By second week in January, vehicles can move on the bridge but we may need additional four weeks to complete the signalization, road painting and demarcation. We are looking forward to fully hand over this project sometimes in February next year,” he said.

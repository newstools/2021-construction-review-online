The project will be located at Jbel Lahdid, near Essaouira on the Atlantic coast of the Cherifian kingdom. The park will be built as part of Morocco’s Integrated Wind Energy Programme which aims to build six wind farms with a total capacity of 1000MW by 2024.

Morocco’s wind power programme is divided into two components. The first involves the construction of a 150MW wind farm in Taza. The second component will enable 850MW of electricity to be supplied to Morocco’s national electricity network. It is being developed by the Moroccan electricity company Nareva and Enel Green Power. The Italian-Moroccan consortium has been awarded the right to design, finance, build, operate and manage the wind farm following a call for tenders in 2016. The Integrated Wind Energy Programme should make it possible to avoid the emissions of about 2.38 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) each year, equivalent to the annual emissions of a city the size of Casablanca.

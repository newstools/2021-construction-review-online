The North El Amriya (NEA) concessions have two discovered and appraised gas fields (Yazzi and Python) while the North Idku (NI) concession has four discovered gas fields, one of which is being prepared for development. Energean plans to develop the Yazzi and Python gas fields as satellite fields to the offshore and onshore infrastructure of the Abu Qir gas-condensate concession.

The UK-based exploration and Production Company will drill a fourth well to develop the NI-1 discovery in the North Idku concession. It plans to install the infrastructure alongside the North El Amriya development to enable the NI-1 well to be hooked up either correspondingly with it or afterward. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_3',117,'0','0']));According to Energean plc, the NEA/NI project has 2P reserves of 49 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), of which 87% is gas. Peak production from the offshore project is expected to be nearly 90mmscf/d of gas and 1kbopd of condensates. The first gas is anticipated to be produced in the second half of next year. In a statement, Energean stated that “the NEA/NI project is a key one for the Egyptian portfolio which will provide substantial benefits to the long-term production profile in the North African country, whilst bringing additional cost efficiencies and strategic benefits. The company has engaged TechnipFMC for engineering, procurement, installation, and construction services for the NEA/NI project.

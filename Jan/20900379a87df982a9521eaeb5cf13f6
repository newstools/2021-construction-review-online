The tower consists of three cylindrical concrete pillar-like structures varying in height and linked together near the towers the first peak using a disc-shaped section that will house in its two floors, an observation deck, and a revolving panoramic restaurant at an altitude of +107 meters where visitors will be able to enjoy spectacular views of the city below while they eat.   Around the pillars of the tower is three transparent stainless steel wings wrapped delicately and protectively around the base of the tower, and they gradually open outwards in a fan-like fashion as they extend up the height of the tower. The lighting design of the project involved equipping the Tower with a screen that shall display the logo of Nigeria, and through the control system, also displaying alternative images in a completely dynamic way. The screen will be fixed with an anchoring system on steel cables to make the element perfectly integrated into the structure and completely transparent when not in use.

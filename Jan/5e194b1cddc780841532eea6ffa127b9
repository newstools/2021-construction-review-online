The construction of the sports facility was started by Tharaka-Nithi Governor Muthomi Njuki when he was Chuka/Igambang’ombe Member of Parliament before the Ministry of Sports took over. Once complete, Kirubia Stadium will have a football pitch, a rugby pitch, an athletics track, a volleyball court and a basketball court. It will be the first stadium in the region and is expected to boost sporting activities. Meanwhile, the county government is also constructing three mini-stadiums; Kathwana at the county headquarters, Nyangumi in Tharaka constituency and Kairuni in Maara constituency.

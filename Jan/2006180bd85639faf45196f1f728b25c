The company provided a statement citing that they hope to have the Miami-Orlando rail line train service operational by the end of 2022, with a planned fare of $45 from Miami to West Palm Beach and $100 from Miami to Orlando. Brightline acquired a rail right of way along the coast of Florida in 2007 and sold track rights for freight to the mining conglomerate Grupo Mexico. It retained passenger track rights. When its Brightline service is completed, its diesel cars will carry passengers more than 235 miles from Miami to Orlando in about three hours.

From Victorville, the 15 Freeway drops more than 3,000 feet through the serpentine Cajon Pass. Brightline and Disney World also reached an agreement and will have a train go through Orlando to the amusement park. Brightline trains would also take two hours to cover the 185 track miles from Barstow to Las Vegas, at an average speed of 92 mph. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0']));The company stated that they will have completed the Miami to West Palm Beach corridor by the third quarter of 2021, the Aventura by the third quarter of 2021, the port of Miami by the first quarter of 2022, Boca Raton by the first quarter of 2022, the extension to Orlando by the fourth quarter of 2022 and the station at the Disney Springs Orlando Theme Park by the fourth quarter of 2023. Brightline stated that they expected the Disney Springs stop to significantly increase their ridership and revenue. They also said they didn’t expect that coronavirus safety measures would affect their Miami-Orlando rail line construction timetable. Brightline said that the stop would be a huge convenience to the millions of people each year heading from South Florida to the theme parks and vice-versa.

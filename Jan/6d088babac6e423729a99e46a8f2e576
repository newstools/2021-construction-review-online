The 15-kilometers Thika Town Bypass road, traversing Kiambu, Murang’a, Machakos, and Nyandarua counties, has recently attained a 70% completion rate and it is expected to be ready for use by June this year. The road construction started two years ago with Tosha Holding Limited, one of the leading companies in construction works across East and Central Africa, as the contractor under the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA), a state corporation with a core mandate of managing, developing, rehabilitating and maintaining national urban trunk roads. According to Patrick Wainaina and Joseph Nduati, the members of parliament for Thika Town and Gatanga respectively, the over US$ 16m  project will not only spur economic developments in the region but also see a massive reduction of traffic snarl-ups that have hampered business activities for years.

According to the Minister of Energy and Hydraulic Resources, Alain-Claude Bilie-By-Nzé,  the project is part of the second “Drinking water” component of the integrated programme for the supply of drinking water and sanitation in Libreville (Piaepal). The project involves renewal of 149km of drinking water distribution networks, as well as the reinforcement and extension of the 131km drinking water distribution network.

HQ Power is owned by a Turkish investor called HAKAN AS, an international power company dubbed Quantum Power, with the participation of Themis, a leading project developer and investor with an exclusive focus on incremental renewable power generation assets in Sub Saharan Africa. Mr. Gubbini said that by March 2021, the plant which is located in Mamba in Gisagara District will start releasing 40 megawatts of electricity into the national grid. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_6',115,'0','0']));“The 40 megawatts will be produced by the part of the plant which is under completion and which will be tested in the course of this month.

Built under a Build Operate, Own and Transfer (BOOT) basis with a 26 year of Power Purchase Agreement, the HQ Power peat will be the largest of its kind in the Eastern African region and the second-largest in Africa. It will also be among the list of those providing the most electricity in the East African country, together with Nyabarongo Hydro Power Plant, which is currently the largest and that produces 28 megawatts of electricity.

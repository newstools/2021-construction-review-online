This follows a call for expressions of interest (EoIs) which was held last year. The tender is for the construction of the first phase of the Noor PV II complex. The project involves six locations: Sidi Bennour (48MW), Kelaa sraghna (48MW), Taroudant (36MW), Bejaad (48MW), El Hajeb (36MW) and Ain Beni Mathar (184MW). The given capacity is in direct current (DC). The call for projects will be open to submissions by January 31, 2021 and winning bidders will be announced in the second quarter. The contracts are due to be signed in the third or fourth quarter of 2021.

This supports Morocco’s target of lifting the share of renewables in its installed power mix to 52% by 2030. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_2',117,'0','0']));The Noor solar plant is a flagship project launched under the ambitious energy policy of the Moroccan Kingdom. It is located in the municipality of Ghessate, in the Southern province of Ouarzazate. Construction of the first phase of the project – Noor I – began in 2013, and reached completion in 2016. On 4th February 2016, King Mohammed VI chaired the commissioning ceremony at the first plant, and officially launched the construction of phase II and III of the solar complex. While Noor I and Noor II use concentrated solar power (CSP) technology to generate electricity with the help of 12-metre-tall mobile parabolic mirrors, Noor III will introduce a technological variation of CSP technology, by using a solar tower. The fourth phase will use photovoltaic technology.

It joins 33MW Excelsior Wind Energy Facility, in the Western Cape; and two solar PV projects in the Northern Cape, namely 46MW Aggeneys Solar and its sister plant 86MW Konkoonsies II Solar, all of which form part of the government’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme’s fourth bid round. According to Sunil Ramkillawan, CEO of Thebe Energy and Resources, thebe’s investment, alongside BioTherm Energy, demonstrates a commitment to growing our portfolio of renewable energy assets and to contribute positively to our country, and deliver on our mandate of “building communities” to make a significant economic impact in South Africa. “We are delighted that the Golden Valley project has achieved COD,” he said. BioTherm Energy’s portfolio extends across South Africa’s boarders into Kenya, where its fifth renewable energy asset is nearing operations, increasing this pan-African renewable power producer’s portfolio close to 400MW. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};Robert Skjodt, CEO of BioTherm Energy, which is majority owned by Actis, a leading emerging markets investor said that bringing four IPPs into operation in South Africa, over the last nine months under challenging circumstances, has been a proud achievement for the company. “Our Kenyan wind energy project, southwest of Nairobi, is already connected to the country’s national grid and energized, so we expect to have our current portfolio fully operational before the close of this quarter,” he said.

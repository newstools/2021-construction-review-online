The funding was provided by JPMorgan Chase who offered a floating-rate loan for the project that will be constructed on 160 West 124th Street Street between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and Malcolm X Boulevard. The site of the building is located where a four-story parking garage was previously operated and was leased to Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine. Construction is slated to be completed by winter of 2022. Once completed, the medical center will be one of the most prominent medical buildings in Upper Manhattan. It will feature several Mount Sinai departments and clinics consolidating in one place.

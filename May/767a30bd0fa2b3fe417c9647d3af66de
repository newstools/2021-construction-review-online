Located in the Dedza district of Malawi near the town of Golomoti, the 20MWac solar PV and 5MW/10MWh energy storage project is set to become a leading project in sub-Saharan Africa in showing the value of solar PV together with energy storage. The project is expected to fully adopt Sungrow’s one-stop solar-plus-storage MV solution comprised of PV inverter, MV station, all-in-one Power Conversion System, battery container, and energy management system (EMS). Sungrow’s PV and storage technologies will be deployed to improve the availability, reliability, and quality of the Malawi power supply through its capabilities in providing frequency regulation, voltage regulation, peak shaving, and reactive power support.

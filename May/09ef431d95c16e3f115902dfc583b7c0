The initial agreement for the Banana deep-water port project in central Kongo dates back to 2018 when a contract was signed between DP World and former Congolese head of state, Joseph Kabila. According to the contract the UAE company would own a 70% stake in the project, with the government owning the remaining 30%. Expected to begin the same year (2018) and be operational within two years, the project could also be subject to a 20-year extension.

The future autonomous port of Banana, whose concession had been entrusted to the Emirati group DP World for 30 years of operation, should require an investment estimated at US$ 1bn. Upon completion, it will be the first deep-water port in the central African country.

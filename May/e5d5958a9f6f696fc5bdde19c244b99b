The government of Malawi is looking into how to unlock US $2.5m for the completion of the Domasi Community Hospital project. According to Vice President Saulos Chilima, there have been issues that have delayed the project which started in 2013 including lack of funding as well as land compensation claims from the community amounting to US $13,880.13. “This is a crucial project that must be completed at all cost. We will take it up so that these compensation issues are resolved,” he said. He further commended contractors for doing a good job in as far as quality is concerned.

The hospital will have a sophisticated laboratory system that will diagnose both communicable and non-communicable diseases.  It will have a maternity wing, paediatric ward and so many other departments which are not found at Domasi Rural Hospital currently in operation. The services to be offered are similar to those of a district hospital and will be a relief for not just Zomba, but surrounding districts as well. Construction of the hospital started in 2012 and was meant to open its doors in 2015. However, work on the health facility was abandoned by the Joyce Banda administration in 2013, only to resume in 2015 after the Peter Mutharika administration pumped in billions through the 2014/15 national budget. The project is 100% funded by the government of Malawi.

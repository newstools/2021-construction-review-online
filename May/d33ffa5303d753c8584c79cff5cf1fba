This is after the City’s Executive Mayor Dan Plato signed off on the project. The major infrastructure development will see a mixed-use development leading to the creation of at least 1100 jobs during the construction phase. The 10.5 hectare Canal District includes expansion projects on either side of Dock Road and surrounding the existing Battery Park Development. The District provides the first point of contact for visitors entering the V&A Waterfront from the city, creating a seamless link to Dock Road in the Waterfront from the CBD. Building height in certain parts of the extension east of Dock Road will be limited to 60 meters – this is considered appropriate sensible planning to increase floor space, given its location in the City Foreshore area, where a number of the tallest buildings are located.

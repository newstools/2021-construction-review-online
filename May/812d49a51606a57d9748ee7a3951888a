The housing project in Delft which is made up of 201 Breaking New Ground (BNG) State-subsidised houses is expected to be completed toward the end of this year, if all goes according to plan. According to Cape Town’s Mayoral Committee Member for Human Settlements, Councillor Malusi Booi, the Eindhoven housing project is an example of the City’s commitment to providing housing opportunities to the most vulnerable and enabling redress. The project will provide homes to more than 800 people. “As with all of our projects, we work according to the Housing Allocation Policy and the Housing Needs Register to be sure of a fair and organised approach to the allocation of opportunities, given the immense need. The beneficiary target areas are determined in consultation with the community’s representatives, and submitted to a Housing Allocation Committee for approval,” he said. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};“It is important that we complete our projects in the shortest possible timeframe as our housing projects across the metro remain under threat of unlawful occupation. Unlawful land occupation is illegal. It is stealing land and stealing opportunities from those who are lawfully on the Register and from those who are in the process of receiving their affordable housing opportunity,” he added.

The facility will consist of a three-hangar development of more than 185,500 square feet at Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport which will be available for occupancy by the fourth quarter of 2021. The facility will be state-of-the-art, multi-tenant, and freestanding full-service hangars which are constructed with steel-frame infrastructure, a metal roof, and metal exterior walls. The steel-frame infrastructure provides clear span bays necessary for aircraft movement. The Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Executive Airpark will also provide office space built to suit tenant’s requirements. The office spaces will have LED overhead lighting with on/off motion sensors in hangars, hangar doors 28 feet high with widths spanning 90’ feet to 110 feet, and sealed concrete floors.

The dimensions of the hangar bays and hangar doors at Gateway Executive Airpark will accommodate larger jets as well as other aviation uses such as maintenance, repair, and overhaul operations. Advantages of the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport location of this project also include lower operating costs and reduced taxes through unique tax programs and incentives. “The aviation industry has grown about 30% from this quarter last year. The improvement is due to not only safety issues but is reflective of economies opening up as well as travel restrictions being reduced” said the principal and executive vice president at DAUM Commercial, Steve McKendry. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center !important;}“We are anticipating strong local demand from high-net-worth individuals as well as large corporations. This space could also be attractive to private jet owners and branded charter services based elsewhere, for example, even with the additional travel required, the significantly lower rental rates, and tax incentives. This makes holding aircraft at the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport approximately 70% less than anywhere in Southern California.” McKendry added.

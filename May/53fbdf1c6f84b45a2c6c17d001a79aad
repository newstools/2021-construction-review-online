The implementation of the Malicounda Dual Fuel Power Project, particularly the construction of the dual-fuel combined cycle power plant in Malicounda, a village in the M’bour Department of the Thiès Region in western Senegal, approximately 67 km from Dakar, is 95% complete.

It will utilize heavy-fuel oil (HFO) as the primary source of energy and it will be converted to natural gas as soon as the latter is available in the West African country. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center !important;}The electricity generated from this power plant will be sold under a 20-year power purchase agreement and fed into the national grid through the existing 225kV substation adjacent to the site. The close to US$ 189M project was developed by MP Energy (previously Melec PowerGen Inc), Senelec (National Electricity Company of Senegal), and Africa 50, an Investment Bank for Infrastructure in Africa. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};The plant is expected to increase the electricity generating capacity in Senegal by 17% at the least while reducing generation costs by approximately 14%. If the savings are passed on to consumers this could result in a 3-7% fall in tariffs and a 1-3% rise in the country’s Gross domestic product (GDP). The plant is also expected to help satisfy base loads, facilitating the integration of intermittent renewable power into the West African country’s network. Noteworthy, this type of combined-cycle power plant produces higher output at higher efficiencies (up to 55%) with lower emissions than the older open-cycle plants presently being used. When converted to gas, the Malicounda Dual Fuel Power Plant will form part of the evolution of Senegal’s energy mix from diesel which currently counts for about 75% of total generation capacity, to renewables, reducing gas emissions significantly.

The company will utilize its experience and know-how that it has acquired through the development of its FSRU concept for security and diversity of energy supply for the Republic of Ireland to help the North African country to meet the demand for natural gas. It is estimated that by 2025 Morocco will need 1.1 billion cubic meters of natural gas, which will increase to 1.7 billion cubic meters after 5 years (2030), and 3 billion cubic meters 15 years later (2040).

According to the Jersey-based oil and gas exploration company, the FSRU project will not interfere with its plans to develop the Guercif that has an estimated 474 billion standard cubic feet of gas and considerable upside potential. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};“This is somewhat a potential continuation of the company’s commercial development strategy in Morocco, which aims to increase future gas exports to Europe, once the Moroccan domestic gas market has reached its full potential,” noted the company in an update on its operations in the North African country. It also announced that it had received the necessary authorizations for the construction of the MOU-1 well platform from its Guercif exploration licenses. The well has tertiary gas potential in areas less than 10 km from the GME pipeline and it is expected to be drilled this coming month.

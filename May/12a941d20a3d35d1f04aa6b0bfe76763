The government budgeted $33.6bn for the second phase and Zimbabwe National Roads Administration (Zinara) has already disbursed $2.3bn as the government intensifies efforts to rehabilitate the country’s road network. According to Zinara spokesperson, Mr Tendai Mugabe a good road network is vital if the country is to realise Vision 2030. “So far, we have disbursed $2.3bn for road works that include ERRP and periodic and routine road maintenance since the beginning of the year. Under ERRP, we have disbursed advance payments to all road authorities and road works have already started in earnest in all provinces,” he said while confirming the disbursement of funds to various road authorities for ERRP2 and other road projects.

As Zinara, we are ready to disburse the funds once we receive the necessary paperwork,” he said. Under ERRP2, the government is targeting to rehabilitate 10 000km of roads countrywide. The rehabilitation and modernisation of the country’s road infrastructure so far have seen the opening of more than 160km to traffic on the Harare-Beitbridge road and the refurbishment of the Karoi-Binga road among other roads.

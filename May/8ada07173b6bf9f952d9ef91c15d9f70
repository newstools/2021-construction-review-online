SDX Energy, which is an international oil and gas exploration, production, and development company headquartered in London, United Kingdom, has commenced the first phase of its 2021 drilling campaign in Morocco. This phase consists of three appraisal/development wells that will target a total of 1.3 billion ft3 of P90/1.8 billion ft3 of P50, gross unrisked prospective recoverable resources, in the Gharb Basin acreage where the company has a 75% operated working interest in five exploration permits. According to Mark Reid, the Chief Executive Officer of SDX, the commencement of this campaign has been delayed by approximately one month due to covid-19 related travel restrictions delaying the mobilization of equipment and personnel into the North African country. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};The first well, OYF-3, will target the Guebbas reservoir at approximately 1160 m while the second well, KSR-17, will target the Hoot reservoir at approximately 1720 m. The third well, KSR-18, is a dual-target well, with the first in the Guebbas reservoir at 1600 m and the second in the Hoot reservoir at around 1790 m.

The company will make use of the drilling rig that is already stacked in its yard in Morocco, and in that way, it will incur minimal mobilization cost. Implementation of the first phase is expected to complete in July this year, after which the second phase will commence 2 months later, in September/October 2021 to be precise. The objective of the entire project according to Mr. Reid “is to add reserves and consequently to allow SDX to continue to deliver gas to our customers in line with their contractual requirements.”

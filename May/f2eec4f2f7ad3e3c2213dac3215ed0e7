The technology-enabled entertainment center will be the first locale to serve the Baltimore community and the third serving the state of Maryland. The Topgolf Baltimore will be constructed on approximately 6 acres of land in the Southern Gateway Entertainment District. The entertainment center will feature a unique skylit central atrium along with comfortable seating, yard games, and a giant video wall. The skylit central atrium creates a hang-out spot that guests will enjoy while watching the action on the patio, bars, and rooftop terraces.

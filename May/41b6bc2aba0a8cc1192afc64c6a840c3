The plant will be owned and operated by Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company and will be brought together by rPlus Energies, a power plant developer based in Utah. Named Graphite Solar I, the site will include a 104 Megawatt (dc) / 80 Megawatt (ac) utility-scale solar plant and will be one of the largest solar plants in Greenbacker’s nationwide portfolio of renewable energy projects. It will provide power to Facebook’s new data center in Eagle Mountain, Utah. The project has a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) in place with the investment-grade utility PacifiCorp and a contract that was developed under Rocky Mountain Power’s Schedule 34 green energy tariff.

The 131-year-old firm specializes in transportation, concrete, building, industrial, and renewable power work and is currently ranked the country’s 52nd largest construction company by ENR. Greenbacker Renewable Energy Company purchased the pre-operational solar project from rPlus Energies late last year. They then went on to contract rPlus to continue to develop the project through construction. Together with rPlus Energies, Sundt Construction will install more than a quarter-million solar panels on the Graphite Solar I site. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center !important;}“Large projects like Graphite Solar I will increasingly be necessary to meet the electricity needs of the technology economy.

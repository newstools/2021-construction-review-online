ENGIE North America has designed and will install 9.8 MW of solar, 150 Level II and DC charging stations, and 2 MW/4.3 MWh of energy storage through its affiliate ENGIE Services US Inc. Once completed, the projects will offset early 230,000 metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions over a 20-year period while saving nearly US$65,000,000 in energy costs over the life of the project.

They are projected to produce 311 GWh over the course of 20 years. This will be enough energy generated to power over 26,500 homes. It will also provide a reduction in CO2 emissions equivalent to taking 47,000 gas vehicles off the road. The California State Compensation Insurance Fund Electric Vehicle charging stations will be available to its employees and used by the company’s fleet vehicles which currently includes eight battery electric vehicles, three of which are new long-range BEVs that allow employees to travel between State Fund locations while lowering their reliance on fossil fuels. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center !important;}“While supporting State Fund’s greater environmental strategy, the construction helps the California economy during this critical time for recovery after the pandemic.

This particular portion has become unsafe for vehicular traffic and a preliminary assessment on the road has called for a complete reconstruction of the road. The City’s Regional Operations and Coordination Department is compelled to close off Olievenhoutbosch Road between Tlokwa Street and Brakfontein Road for the duration of the construction and repair works which are expected to run until 30th June. Business facilities in that area will be accessible via a detour route along Old Johannesburg Road from the North and South directions through the use of temporary traffic signs.

Back in December 2019, the Ivorian authorities approved the technical and financial offer submitted by a consortium comprising the French groups Bouygues Travaux Publics, Alstom, Colas Rail, and Keolis for the construction of this metro line. France then agrees to cover the contract with a mix of loans from the French Treasury and private financing guaranteed by the French State. The contract was signed in the presence of French President Emmanuel Macron, visiting Côte d’Ivoire, and commissioning was mentioned for 2026. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};Ivory Coast had initially signed an agreement with a French-South Korean consortium for the construction of the Abidjan metro, which has been on the pipeline for over two decades, on a build, operate, and transfer basis. The consortium included Bouygues, Keolis, Hyundai Rotem, and Dongsan Engineering but the South Korean partners withdrew from the project in October 2017.

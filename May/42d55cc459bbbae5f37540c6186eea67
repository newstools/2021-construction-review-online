The park was constructed on land that was previously occupied by the Kosciuszko Bridge and occupies nearly seven acres of land in the North Brooklyn neighborhood. Oversight of the construction was done by the State Department of Transportation and the operation and maintenance of the park will be done by the North Brooklyn Parks Alliance. The park is fully connected to the existing shared-use path on the Brooklyn-bound span of the Kosciuszko Bridge. This will enable pedestrians and bicyclists to enjoy even more recreational activities as a result of this transformative bridge project. It will be open daily from dawn until dusk.

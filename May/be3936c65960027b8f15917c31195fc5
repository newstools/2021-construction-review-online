Uganda’s Parliament has approved a US $395.5m loan the refurbishment of the Kampala-Malaba Meter Gauge Railway (MGR). The approval in a plenary sitting Chaired by Speaker Rebecca Kadaga came after the approval of a report by the National Economy Committee presented by Nakaseke North MP Syda Bbumba. According to Hon Bbumba, the Kampala- Malaba project is part of the bigger proposed Meter Gauge Railway (MGR) project, which will entail the rehabilitation of the 8.3km Kampala-Port Bell section and the 12.3km Kampala-Nalukolongo-Kyengera section, purchase and rehabilitation of coaches, wagons and locomotives, creation of a railway training school to equip Uganda Railways Corporation (URC) Management and Staff with modern railway skills, and stock new spares for the workshop. “If the Meter Gauge Railway Project (MGR) is implemented, the cost of transport by rail will improve from the current average of between US Dollars 0.09 – US $0.13 (per NTK-net tone kilometre) to US $0.05, hence reducing the cost of doing business,” said the MP.

The government of Tanzania is planning to build a total of 1000 secondary schools across the country in an effort to ensure that every ward has access to such level of education. This was revealed by Deputy Minister of State in the President’s Office (Regional Administration and Local Government) David Silinde after he was queried by Mbagala MP Jafari Chaurembo, on when the government would build secondary schools in Mbagala, Kilungule and KibondeMaji Wards, which have no secondary schools at all. According to the Deputy Minister all those wards will have secondary schools which are part of the government’s plan to build 1000 secondary schools nationwide in all wards that do not have that level of education. “Among the wards that will benefit are those mentioned by the MP of Mbagala, Kilungule and KibondeMaji Wards,” he said.

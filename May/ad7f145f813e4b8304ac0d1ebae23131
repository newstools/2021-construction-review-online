The more often we do maintenance, the better the chances of prolonging the longevity of this important asset. We understand that roadworks come with some level of inconvenience and we try our best to minimise this. No road closures are anticipated with any of these works, however, we appeal to residents and motorists to please exercise extra caution when moving around the construction sites,” said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Transport, Alderman Felicity Purchase. “Where necessary, flag personnel will regulate traffic flow either by temporary lane diversions or temporary lane closures around the works. We will also have signage in place and urge residents to play their part by complying with the signage that is displayed during the construction period and ensure that their vehicles are not parked in an obstructive manner. This will ensure that the projects run without disruptions and that delays are minimal,” he added. Furthermore, the City anticipates that traffic flow will be impeded in areas where construction is taking place and they may be congested, thus, we recommend that road users consider using alternative roads to avoid unnecessary delays.

Generally, this system aims to prevent human error and contribute to less dependence on humans, in order to increase the safety and security of railway lines. According to AfDB, the planned upgrades are expected to benefit low-income Egyptians, about 40 percent of the population, who rely on trains as an affordable mode of transport. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};The credit facility comes days after a deadly train accident in the southern governorate of Sohag, last month where a speeding passenger train collided with another one that had stopped suddenly, resulting in the injury of dozens and the death of 8 passengers. 93

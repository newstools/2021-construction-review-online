However, to this point the horizontal works, including the construction of runaways and other infrastructure that are required for an airplane to land, are nearly 40% complete,” Also Read: Tanzania approves US $160.5m for construction of Isaka-Mwanza SGR line “We have also started recruitments for construction of terminals and other required buildings, and we plan to start the works in the next two months.

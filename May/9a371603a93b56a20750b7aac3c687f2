While addressing the people of the Nuba region during a visit to the city of Kidintakar, Hamdok emphasized that all major projects on River Nile ought to be subjected to economic, social, and environmental studies, in which local communities would be, “original partner in the decision-making process and the gains emanating from the projects.” Also Read: Juba power plant in South Sudan to cease its operations, says ECDG if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};“The northern Sudanese states have been largely marginalized in all development plans in the past. Now, it is about time for all local communities to be part of any decision [to carry out projects] and to benefit from the revenues of these projects,” said the Sudanese prime minister. When first unveiled the dam projects triggered mass protests from local communities, who feared that the two dam projects would drown all Nubian areas and archaeological sites south of Halfa to Dongola and destroy more than 600 archaeological sites, some dating back to the Stone Age. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};At the beginning of last year, the Sudanese government and the Sudanese Revolutionary Front rebel alliance signed an agreement on the northern track that called for new studies for proposed dams in the Nile, compensation for people displaced by dams that are already built, the construction of new roads, and the burial of electronic and nuclear waste in Northern State. This agreement which resulted in the cancelation of the Dal and Kajbar dam projects ended 17 years of conflict in the southern states of South Kordofan and the Blue Nile.

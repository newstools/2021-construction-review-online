The US $54.4m project, which involves re-carpeting and upgrading of the roads to cabro and asphalt (bitumen) standard, was launched in November last year but contractors commenced the works this January. The project also involves the installation of additional road furniture including walkways and cycling lanes where adequate space is available. Already, a total of 57.2km of access roads have been constructed across the more than 12 informal settlements. According to Kura, 5.3km has been done in Mukuru slums, another 18.6km in Dagoretti, 10.8km in Kawangware, 2.1km in Kangemi, 1.7km in Kibera and 1.2km in Korogocho slums. Another 23.5km has been upgraded in Dandora, Utawala, Mihang’o and Ruai areas, 10.9km in Kasarani, 17.8km in Githurai, 7.7km in Roysambu and 1.5km in Mathare.

The roads will open up the slums and connect them with other parts of Nairobi,” he said. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};He further mentioned that the lack of accessibility in the areas has presented difficulties during emergency and disaster responses including fire outbreaks, among others. “Through this project, the government is bringing back dignity, sanity to the slums. If you have been in the slums you will know how setting up access roads is almost impossible due to lack of space,” he added According to the overall plan, a total of 70km will be upgraded in Mukuru slums, 57.48km in Githurai, 50.76km in Roysambu; another 42km in Mwiki, 41km in Kangemi and 40km in Dandora, Utawala, Mihang’o and Ruai. Dagoretti will take up 30km, Kawangware 22.6km, Kibera 22.8km, Mathare 18.2km and Korogocho 13.6km.

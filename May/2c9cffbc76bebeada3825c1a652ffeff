The initial phase of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim LNG Project, an offshore liquefied natural gas development based on upstream gas production in 2km-deep waters on the maritime border of Mauritania and Senegal is reportedly over 58% complete. This is as seen on Kosmos Energy Ltd.’s financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2021. According to the company, which is developing the project alongside BP, Societe des Petroles du Senegal (Petrosen), and Societe Mauritanienne des Hydrocarbures (SMHPM), significant progress has been made on all major sites, including the floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit, the floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility, the central terminal (concrete breakwater) and the deepwater subsea production system that comprises four gas production wells.

However, due to some unexpected interruptions like the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic at the beginning of last year, the first gas is expected in the first half of 2023. Once operational, the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim project will produce gas from the ultra-deepwater subsea system and the mid-water FPSO vessel that will process the gas, removing heavier hydrocarbon components. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};The gas will then be transferred to the FLNG facility at an innovative nearshore hub located on the Mauritania and Senegal maritime border. The FLNG facility is designed to provide circa 2.5 million tonnes of LNG per annum on average, with the total gas resources in the field estimated to be around 15 trillion cubic feet. The project, which is the first major gas project to reach FID in the basin, is planned to provide LNG for global export as well as making gas available for domestic use in both Mauritania and Senegal.

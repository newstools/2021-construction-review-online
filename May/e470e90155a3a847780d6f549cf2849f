This is according to GECOL, a Libyan company responsible for the operation and servicing of the North African country’s electric networks, stations of energy production, and their distribution, as well as transformation stations. The construction of the 671 MW Simple Cycle Power Plant will be carried out by a consortium comprising Enka İnşaat ve Sanayi A.Ş., a Turkish engineering, and construction company based in Istanbul, and Siemens AG, a German multinational conglomerate company headquartered in Munich, as per an agreement signed with GECOL back in 2017. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center !important;}The project is based on a power island configuration for four SGT5-PAC 2000E Siemens combustion turbine generator (CTG) units that will be dual-fuel fired with light fuel oil and natural gas.

GECOL said that the West Tripoli power plant project is part of a plan and efforts to increase power generation capacity in Libya, in a bid to decrease outages. The plan also includes the construction of two more similar plants (i.e Misrata power plant with 640 megawatts capacity, and Tobruk power plant with 740 megawatts) by the same consortium. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};When completed, approximately by March next year, these power plants will improve production capacity and strengthen the North African country’s electricity infrastructure, and contribute to efforts to fill the electricity defect in the nation. GECOL called for uniting efforts in the public and private sectors as well as other fields of business and work to preserve the country’s electricity and indicated that Libyans need to understand the position of its work and efforts until these urgent projects are completed. 100

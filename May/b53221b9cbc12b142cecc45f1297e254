The City has invested over US $780,356.06 in this project. The construction works involves the removal of the existing road layers and the in-situ recycling of the underlying granular layers. A new asphalt surfacing will be implemented after that. The contractor will also repair and raise gravel shoulders to tie into the new surface level, and put new road markings once the asphalt work is complete. According to the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Transport Alderman Purchase, the upgrade of these roads forms part of the efforts to address road maintenance in Durbanville in a planned manner. “These two sections are important access routes within the road network in the area. St Johns Road is a key link to the Bellville area and N1. Regular road maintenance improve the longevity of the road network which is one of the City’s most important assets as it enables movement of people and goods, and economic activity which lead to growth,” he said.

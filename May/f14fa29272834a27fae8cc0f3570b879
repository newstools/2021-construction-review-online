The project, funded by the Foreign Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO), and implemented by the Government of Somaliland (GoSL) through the Ministry of Transport and Roads Development with the support of Trademark East Africa (TMEA), involves the upgrade of the 22.5 kilometers Hargeisa By-pass into a 2 lanes single carriageway. The project team includes COCC-GCI JV, Kagga & Partners, and ITEC Engineering Ltd who are undertaking the projects’ civil works, overseeing the project’s design & supervision, and carrying out the project’s technical audit respectively.

The latter is in support of the Berbera Corridor project which stands to enhance the trade and transit capacity and provide Ethiopia’s expanding trade volumes with an alternative sea route, reducing over-reliance on the Djibouti route which is currently used for 95% of the East African country’s exports. During the construction phase of the Hargeisa By-pass, particular attention is being paid to climate-proofing so as to ensure that the road is built to last. Protection of local heritage is also a key consideration, bearing in mind that the project is in close proximity to the iconic Nasa Hablood hills – the symbol of Hargeisa city.

The park will expand the greenery into about an acre of land at 111 Paterson Avenue. The property was formerly owned by Academy Bus. It was the subject of several battles that spanned multiple years the city of Hoboken acquired the site for US$11 million and amended the Southwest Hoboken Redevelopment Plan. Academy Bus has now been allowed to construct 25 additional residential units on other properties they own in the neighborhood. Designed by Kimley Horn, the pop-up park will include an area for hopscotch, a basketball court, picnic tables, a playground with shade sails, and a section dedicated to community gardens.

This expansion is a temporary measure to bridge the gap while the city plans a permanent version. The permanent version will include resiliency measures like an underground water retention system to help mitigate flooding in the neighborhood. Ruben Ramos, the Council President said; “this has been a long road but the park will serve as the centerpiece for the continuing revitalization of Southwest Hoboken and we will be working to have the space available for use as a pop-up park for the summer and also working with the public as to what will be included in the final design.” if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0_1')}; .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;padding:0;text-align:center !important;}“After many months of negotiating with Academy, I am very happy to have come to an agreement that will finally double the size of our Southwest Resiliency Park,” said Mayor Ravi Bhalla. “This agreement not only allows us to create more open space in our neighborhood but also does so without trading massive residential density rights and I am looking forward to working with the community on the design of this park while providing immediate benefits to the neighborhood with a pop-up park this summer.” 100%

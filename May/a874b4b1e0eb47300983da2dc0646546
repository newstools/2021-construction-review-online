The Bridge Loan structure provides the Company with additional advantages including the ringfencing of debt at the Ncondezi Green Power subsidiary level and additional optionality and time to further explore refinancing options. The Company plans to refinance the Bridge Loan once the Project enters commercial operation and has been materially de-risked, although discussions with potential funders have already begun,” he added. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};“All equipment has been successfully transported to Mozambique and the installation of solar panels is over 50% complete,” he revealed.

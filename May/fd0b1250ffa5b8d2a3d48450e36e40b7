The announcement was made by Centamin Plc, a mineral exploration, development, and mining company that together with the Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources exploits the mine which is located in the Nubian Desert/Eastern Desert near the Red Sea. Currently, the mine operates off-grid and relies completely on a diesel power station, a situation that Centamin expects to change through the establishment of the approximately US$ 37M new energy solution that takes advantage of the location of the mine, characterized by high solar irradiance. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};The area has an average of over ten hours of sunshine a day throughout the year.

The solar portion of the project will utilize bifacial PV modules and a single-axis tracking system. The entire project will be integrated into the existing off-grid network using Juwi Hybrid IQ micro-grid technology to support the diesel units. In a separate statement, the renewable energy company said that it will operate and maintain the hybrid plant, which is expected to start operation in the second quarter of next year, post-commissioning. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};“The renewable energy solution is expected to lower operating costs at the Sukari mine, save between US$ 9M and US$ 13M in annual fuel costs, and reduce exposure to fuel price volatility, among other benefits,” said Centamin.

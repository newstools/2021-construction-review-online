Developed by China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), the Niger-Benin pipeline project entails the construction of a total of 1,980km cross-border crude oil pipeline that will connect the Agadem Rift Basin (ARB) region in Niger to Port Seme Terminal in Benin. The project also comprises the construction of a total of nine intermediate stations. Upon completion, the entire pipeline, which is being constructed along with the second phase development of the Agadem oilfield, will be capable of delivering up to 90,000bpd of crude oil to the Port Seme export terminal located on the Atlantic Coast in Benin. The pipeline project, along with the two-phased Agadem oilfield development, will have a total output of more than 5.5 million tons (Mt).

As part of the project, an office of the distribution grid of the city will be constructed in the proposed national grid control center with funding from the World Bank. Also, a backup center with the main functions of the national control center will be built in Gorou Banda. The main national grid control center in Niamey will be equipped with the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system and EMS (Energy Management System) while the backup center in Gorou Banda will be fitted with the simplified SCADA/EMS system.

The proposed national grid control center in Niamey will upon completion supervise and control the entire high-voltage grid, the power plants of the NIGELEC (Nigerian Electricity Company) and of any other producer connected to the grid, and the operation of the cross-border exchanges, remotely. Owing to its modern tools, the control center will also provide a synthetic and overall vision of the state of the power grid and facilitate its operation to ensure that customers in the West African country have a stable and high-quality electricity supply. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};In addition, it will help its management to make the most appropriate decisions, with optimum reliability and security, and automate the management of the grid while improving the profitability of the Nigerian Electricity Company.

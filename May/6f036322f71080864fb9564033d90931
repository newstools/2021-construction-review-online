La Mé drinking water treatment plant, one of West Africa’s largest drinking water treatment plants built in Côte d’Ivoire on the road to Grand Alépé, a village that is approximately 40 kilometers north of Abidjan is expected to come online in July this year. This was announced by Laurent Tchagba, the Ivorian Minister of Hydraulics at the end of a tour of the districts of Abobo PK18 and Abobo Anonkoua Kouté Extension that are facing drinking water shortages. 1 During the tour the minister observed that the construction works for the project, which is designed and supervised by Veolia, are almost complete. The global water and waste management giant (Veolia) is working hand in hand with PFO Africa on the implementation of the project with funding from the West African Development Bank (BOAD). if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4-0')};The drinking water treatment plant is built on an 8-hectare site. It has a planned capacity of 240,000 m3 per day. The treated water in this facility will be pumped from the nearby La Mé River, thanks to a water intake put up on a hectare site. After treatment, the drinking water will be transported via a 1,400-diameter pipeline over a length of 28 km to two water towers of 5,000 m³ each from where it will be delivered to consumers.

It will also allow more sustainable management of the aquifer around the city preventing both the depletion and pollution of groundwater resources, improving the living conditions of its occupants thereby. a

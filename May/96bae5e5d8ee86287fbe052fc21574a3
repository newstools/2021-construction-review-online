Speaking during the commissioning ceremony of the project, Eng. Tony Attah, the NLNG Managing Director said that the construction and commissioning of the corporate head office were in line with the company’s vision of becoming a global LNG player and helping to build a better Nigeria. The managing director added that the corporate head office has made the company more visible and that it is, with no doubt, a statement that NLNG remains a committed partner to the people of Rivers State in the sustainable development of the state. “The decision to relocate from Lagos state demonstrates our strong bond of friendship with Port Harcourt and Rivers State at large even as we reinforce our commitment to stand tall as a Nigerian brand in the global marketplace. By this action, we also attest that this state is not just the ‘Treasure Base of the West African Nation’ but the home of uncommon hospitality which we have come to enjoy and reciprocate at every given opportunity.

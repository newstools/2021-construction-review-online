Generally, the Port of Bargny-Sendou project will unclog the capital and provide users with a modern infrastructure asset that will facilitate the reception of large vessels and consequently lead to a considerable reduction in the costs of loading and unloading of seaborne products. Upon completion of the entire construction works, Port of Bargny-Sendou will become the largest bulk port in the whole of the West Africa region.

The Congolese National Police Judo Sports Center is funded to the tune of US$ 13M non-repayable aid from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), a governmental agency that delivers the bulk of Official Development Assistance for the government of Japan. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};This aid is subject to a grant agreement signed by the agency and the Government of the DRC back in 2018 in support of the “sport for tomorrow” initiative launched by the former Prime Minister of Japan Abe Shinzo with the objective of promoting sports in the world and more specifically in the Central African country. According to Ambassador Hiro, the sports facility will not only promote sports activities in the country but also the coexistence between the Police Nationale Congolaise (PNC) or rather the Congolese National Police and the civilian population since it is built within the General Police Station.

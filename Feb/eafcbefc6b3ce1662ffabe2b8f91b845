According to Minister of Homeland Security Richard Chimwendo Banda, the government had set five years to construct 10,000 houses for law enforcement agencies, but they are starting with 2,500 houses. “We look at priority areas where the need is dire without looking at geographical position,” he said. The minister further added that the government is confident that within five years it will build more than 10,000 houses for Malawi security personnel because the need for housing for the men in uniform is huge.

According to him, officers lack access to decent housing and where it is available, it is in dilapidated state. Furthermore, most State security personnel across the country live in rented or dilapidated institutional houses which are more of degrading and sometimes inhuman. He therefore asked the government to construct houses for police officers and a fence at Nchalo Police Station. eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_2',117,'0','0']));State security institutions include Malawi Defence Force (MDF), Malawi Prison Service, Malawi Police Service, Immigration and citizenship Services. Back in 2019 Lands, Housing and Urban Development Minister, Symon Vuwa Kaunda, said that the government is committed to building houses for security personnel to ensure improved accomodation standards.

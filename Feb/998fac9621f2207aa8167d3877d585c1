Construction of seed school in Kitayunjwa, Uganda is now complete. The administration block, laboratories, six classroom blocks and three units of the staff quarters have been finalized.. The US $518,245.71 project has faced a lot of challenges including site issues. Initially, it was to be built at St Andrews Secondary School, Naminage but the church set restrictive conditions which eventually led to its relocation to Kitayunjwa Primary School. The relocation did not work out and eventually Mr. Julius Dhimukika, donated six acres of land for the construction to begin. According to the outgoing Kamuli District chairman, Mr Thomas Kategere, the progress of the school construction and readiness of students are an indicator of the thirst for education and justification of his insistence to construct the school at all costs for public good. “In the spirit of sustaining Bishop Bamwoze’s legacy and passion for education, local authorities resolved to name it Bishop Bamwoze Memorial Seed Secondary School to honour him,” he said. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));The Ministry of Education and Sports has also declared vacant teaching posts for the school, meaning the teachers who have been volunteering are going to have the priority of being regularised on appointment of the board of governors.

The institute will bring together scientists from several molecular-based disciplines to do collaborative research work, using approaches relying on molecular design, discovery, and development. The project, approximately 90,0000 square feet and estimated to cost US$36 million, includes imaging and science research laboratories, administrative and research offices, a lecture hall, a multipurpose gathering space, and associated building support spaces. The project will also include the construction of the associated site work and underground utilities.

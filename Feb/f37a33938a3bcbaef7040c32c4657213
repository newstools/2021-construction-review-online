The deal was signed between the state-owned power producer embodied by its Managing Director, Rebecca Miano, and Office Djiboutien de developpement de l’energie geothermique (ODDEG) (in English; Djiboutian office of geothermal energy development) in the presence of Kenya’s Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter, Djibouti’s Minister of Energy & Natural Resources H.E. Honourable Yonis Ali Guedi, amongst other officials from both countries. Owing to the deal the Horn of Africa country, which plans to exploit part of its 1000 MW potential in the geothermal sector as per a 2016 report, will be able to benefit from the experience of KenGen, which has drilled more than 300 wells in the geothermal area of ​​Olkaria.

According to Ms. Miano, the company’s diversification strategy of leveraging its expertise in the field will record a major success when the three wells become productive and enhance Djibouti’s efforts towards growing its energy production. “We, therefore, hope that in the next couple of years, we shall have considerable presence in countries within the continent. It is also worth noting that we are not only keen on increasing our presence in Africa, but also enhancing energy capacities across the region,” said Ms. Miano. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1','ezslot_1',612,'0','0']));This is the third drilling contract the company has won on the continent.

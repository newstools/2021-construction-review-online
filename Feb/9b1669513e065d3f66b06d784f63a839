The TMC will be put up on a newly acquired 10-acre parcel of land in the City Cabanas area along the East African country capital city’s Mombasa Road. The center will be an integrated building with several floors housing smart traffic control systems and different stakeholders involved in traffic management in the city including engineers, system specialists, and traffic police officers. The future Integrated Traffic Management Centre will mainly utilize an Intelligent Transport System (ITS) which comprises intelligent cameras and variable timing traffic lights as well as a command center.

According to Kura Chief Corporate Communications Officer Mr. John Cheboi, the TMC will be a three-in-one facility where BRT, commuter rail, and traffic will be controlled from.

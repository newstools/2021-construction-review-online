The SRSSP program comprises physical infrastructure, and institutional and policy strengthening components. The physical infrastructure component includes the construction of new or expansion/rehabilitation of existing wastewater treatment plants, the construction and upgrading of pumping stations, and the construction of integrated sewerage networks consisting of collectors and pumping mains. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1','ezslot_5',612,'0','0']));This component, under which the Houd Negaih wastewater treatment plant project is, will provide sanitation services to about 175,000 households in 133 villages of five governorates namely, Dakahliya, Sharkiya, Damietta, Menoufya, and Gharbiya.

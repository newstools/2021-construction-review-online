Jambiani Secondary School classrooms in South Unguja, Zanzibar are set to undergo renovations. The school recently received donations of 200 galvanised iron sheets and some building materials from NMB Bank Branch in Zanzibar towards the project. According to NMB Bank Dar es Salam Zonal Manager Donatus Richard, the bank has decided to work with the entire community around Jambiani to address the challenge of leaking classrooms during the rainy season and hence improve a learning environment. “NMB has made these donations as part of their corporate social responsibility,” he said during the handover ceremony at the school.

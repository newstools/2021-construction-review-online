The Essor project is an initiative of the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in partnership with the British government. Funding of US$ 100m will be mobilized by the consortium for the implantation of the projects in the three towns. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_4',117,'0','0']));Upon completion, the three sites will help supply 460,000 inhabitants in the three localities which were chosen for their economic dynamism as well as the lack of reliable, affordable, and clean operational alternatives for short and medium term electrification. The Essor project ultimately plans to equip 23 additional localities while the government of the Central African country aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 17% come the year 2030.

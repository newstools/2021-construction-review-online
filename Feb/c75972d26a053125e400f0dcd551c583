The state of Michigan has released a 5-year project plan for road and bridge construction with a set budget of US$4.17 Billion in 2021. The work is expected to support 45,6000 jobs. About US$3.6 billion will be used for system preservation projects, maintenance, safety programs and operation of the state’s trunkline roads and bridges. Another US$604 million in state, federal, local and private funds are budgeted to maintain Michigan’s Multi-Modal Program, which provides capital, operating assistance, technical support and safety oversight to the state’s air, rail, marines and ports, local and intercity bus sectors of the transportation system. The document spans from 2021 to 2025 and includes information about the department’s planned road and bridge projects, mobility initiatives and financials.

Some of those bridges include: M-53 over Clinton River Trail, the M-53 over Utica Road, the M-53 over Canal Road, the M-53 over 19 Mile Road, north and south.

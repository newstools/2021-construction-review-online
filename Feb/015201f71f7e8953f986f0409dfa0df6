The deadline was initially set for January 31st this year but now, Independent Power Producers (IPPs) interested in the project have until the 11th of this month to submit their bids.

The latter will be able to sign concession contracts as early as the third or fourth quarter of the same year. This tender process is part of Morocco’s Noor solar programme that was introduced back in 2009 with the goal of adding at least 2GW of solar PV across the country. This supports Morocco’s target of lifting the share of renewables in its installed power mix to 52% by 2030. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_3',117,'0','0']));The Noor solar plant is a flagship project launched under the ambitious energy policy of the Moroccan Kingdom. It is located in the municipality of Ghessate, in the Southern province of Ouarzazate. Construction of the first phase of the project – Noor I – began in 2013, and reached completion in 2016. On 4th February 2016, King Mohammed VI chaired the commissioning ceremony at the first plant and officially launched the construction of phases II and III of the solar complex. While Noor I and Noor II use concentrated solar power (CSP) technology to generate electricity with the help of 12-meter-tall mobile parabolic mirrors, Noor III will introduce a technological variation of CSP technology, by using a solar tower. The fourth phase will use photovoltaic technology.

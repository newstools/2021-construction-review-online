The clearance from the FTA allows L.A. Metro to potentially seek some type of funding in the federal pipeline for the final design and construction of the 15-kilometer project, which is planned to connect the Van Nuys Metro “G” (Orange) Line Station with the San Fernando Metrolink Station. The light-rail line will travel primarily along Van Nuys Boulevard, one of the Valley’s most heavily traveled corridors.

Most of the funding will come from local Measure M, Measure R and State funds. The project now could be well-positioned for expanded opportunities to compete for any future federal funding opportunities as part of L.A. Metro’s “Shovel Ready” Plan to move major rail, bus, and highway projects closer to implementation. L.A. Metro will present its board with recommendations for a comprehensive federal grant strategy for its major transit projects this spring. With an end-to-end travel time of 31 minutes, daily boardings are anticipated to exceed 30,000 by the year 2040. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','1']));L.A. Metro Director Paul Krekorian said “The East San Fernando Valley Light Rail project has been one of my top transportation priorities since I was elected to the city council. This critical backbone project will be the first light rail line in the Valley, connecting communities, revitalizing neighborhoods, reducing congestion, and improving air quality. Last month, we pushed the project forward with a US$30-million investment in utility work to expedite construction. Now, with the Federal Transportation Authority’s Record of Decision, this line becomes eligible for federal funding opportunities, and we are well on our way toward full funding and completion of the foundation for the future of transit in the San Fernando Valley.”

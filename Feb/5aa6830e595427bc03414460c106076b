7 Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) have been appointed by Razzmatazz Civil (PTY) Ltd to take part in the ongoing Routine Road Maintenance (RRM) on the N8 between Rooisand and Vaal River, in the Pixley Ka Seme District Municipality and Siyancuma Local Municipality. The US $2.2m project was awarded to Razzmatazz Civil (PTY) Ltd as the contractor in August 2020, who then advertised work packages for subcontractors. Tenders for subcontracting closed in the first week of December 2020 and have been awarded to seven subcontractors who have already reported to site. According to Gretchen Weber-Cherry, SANRAL Project Manager, To ensure maximum project participation from the local communities, at least 50% of the RRM works are structured into sustainable packages which are let on tender at regular cycles. “This ensures we spread the economic opportunities to give more eligible businesses opportunities to participate in SANRAL projects,” he explained.

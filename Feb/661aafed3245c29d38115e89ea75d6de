The contract was signed in the presence of the Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy, Dr. Mohamed Shaker. This strategic project will provide EETC with a fully engineered solution based on a 200-megavolt ampere (MVAR) STATCOM to be connected to the existing 220 kilovolt (kV) Owainat substation, thus enabling grid expansion and providing more power for rural development and a rapidly increasing population. Hitachi ABB Power Grids’ technology and engineering capabilities will help the country reclaim untapped land in the vast Western Desert, where projects are underway to sustainably improve social and economic conditions for Egyptian communities.

The government of the Republic of Madagascar through the Madagascan Ministry of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene is set to construct 46 boreholes in Tananarive (in French) or other Antananarivo (in English), the capital city of the East African country. On the 29th of January this year the Madagascan Ministry of Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene said that it had identified the sites for the implementation of the projects in question. The hunting work for the sites was carried out by technicians from the ministry in collaboration with others from Jiro sy Rano Malagasy (Jirama), the state-owned electric utility and water Services Company in Madagascar. According to Voahary Rakotovelomananstoa, Madagascar’s Minister of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, the company that distributes water and electricity on the big island is struggling to meet the needs of consumers. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','1']));“The suburbs of the capital for example only receive water for two hours a day.

Last year but one, the state-owned electric utility and water services company in Madagascar entrusted the rehabilitation and capacity extension of these units to the Commercial Building and Public works Company also known as Société de Constructions et de Bâtiments (SCB) S.A., as part of the Jirama Water III project. The works carried out will increase the production capacity of Mandroseza’s drinking water stations by 40,000 cubic meters per day, for a total capacity of 204,000 cubic meters. However, the water needs of the populations and companies of the capital city are estimated at 300,000 m3 per day.

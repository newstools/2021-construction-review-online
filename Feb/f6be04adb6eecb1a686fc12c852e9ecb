Since its inception more than 30 years ago, Hydraform has been at the forefront of soil-cement technology. The company name stems from – Hydraulic + Formation = ‘Hydraform’. Hydraform, like all great companies, started business based out of Jochen Kofahl’s garage, back in 1988. Jochen had a dream that high-quality bricks could be created with nothing more than a 20-percent addition of building cement to soil, formed in a machine under hydraulic pressure. That dream gave rise to South Africa’s first brickmaking company that designed, developed and marketed a patented brick-making machine that was truly portable and operated on-site. Just nine months after Jochen started his company, he was joined by business partner, Robert Plattner. Together, they created the M1 machine, which was used to create the very first home built with Hydraform blocks, in Witbank. MIX DESIGN PRODUCTIONThe unique interlocking, mortarless design means significant reductions in building costs, and is backed by Agrement Certificate 96/237 that is issued by the CSIR in Pretoria. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0'])); BRICK AND BLOCKMAKING MACHINESToday, Hydraform have developed a range of machines that offer a full turnkey functionality.

Customers will significantly benefit from the combined power,” says Viktor Várkonyi, Chief Division Officer of the Planning & Design Division and Member of the Executive Board of the Nemetschek Group. “Precast technologies are one of the top trends in AEC technologies. By seamlessly integrating our leading engineering platform from Allplan and the downstream manufacturing processes from Precast, we will be able to offer a market-leading, comprehensive solution from structural engineering to manufacturing and construction. This solution will improve collaboration and efficiency across the entire building lifecycle and accelerate digitalization in the AEC industry.” Allplan, headquartered in Munich, is a global provider of BIM solutions for the AEC industry with a strong competence in engineering. Precast Software Engineering is a specialist for precast concrete elements, providing software solutions and services for the industrialized construction industry. Both companies have earned a peerless reputation for their quality and accessibility amongst engineers. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','1']));The offerings of both companies perfectly complement each other. The merge will create a comprehensive solution, extending the seamlessly integrated BIM workflow from engineering to manufacturing and construction. By combining both businesses, Nemetschek Group will be providing a unique solution for its customers that supports the growing demand of industrialized construction processes. The precast software solution PLANBAR is already based on the Allplan platform. With this closer integration, engineers and construction companies will be able to transfer BIM models to industrial production completely digitally. Also, precast manufacturers can build on existing BIM models from designers and integrate them directly into the production process. eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_3',117,'0','0']));With the merge, these two successful companies will be functionally integrated under the roof of Allplan.

The US $24.6m Naivasha ICD-Longonot railway line project is currently 50% complete. The project involves the construction of a new 24.35km Meter Gauge Railway line linking Naivasha ICD with the existing Meter Gauge Railway (MGR) line at Longonot and also the construction of two new railway stations. According to the Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC), the project would integrate the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and the MGR in a bid to provide a seamless network to facilitate movement of cargo from the Port of Mombasa to Lake Victoria in Kisumu and also Malaba, the border point with Uganda.

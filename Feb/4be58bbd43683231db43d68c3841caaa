The hospital is expected to begin admitting patients in May. According to NMS Director General, Major General Mohamed Badi, the agency has already made a request to the national government to set aside some money to equip the hospital, with the procurement process underway. “NMS is negotiating with the National Treasury to ensure the health facility is up and running before the end of the current financial year in June. We are hopeful that, once the infrastructure is completed next month, we will start employing doctors, nurses and other staff,” said the DG.

Located in Mathare North, the facility will be at the same level as the Mama Lucy Hospital which is also being upgraded. The hospital is also expected to have more than 300 medics. According to the DG, the hospital, together with 24 others which are nearing completion and will soon be operational, will reduce the burden on the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), as well as Mbagathi, Mama Lucy and Pumwani hospitals.

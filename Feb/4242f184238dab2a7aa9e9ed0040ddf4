The government of South Africa is currently ‘conceptualising’ a number of post-apartheid smart cities in provinces around the country. According to President Cyril Ramaphosa, these infrastructure projects form a key part of the government’s Covid-19 recovery plan. “Planning for one of these cities has already begun in the Lanseria region in Gauteng. The Lanseria Smart City, the first new city to be built in a democratic South Africa, is now a reality in the making,” he said during the 2021 state of the nation address. He also added that the draft masterplan for this smart city which will become home to between 350,000 to 500,000 people within the next decade, was completed in November 2020 and is now out for public comment. Moreover, he said that the government’s over US $6.8bn infrastructure fund is now in operation and the country has billions of dollars in planned infrastructure development, including upgraded highways. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','1']));“We have now developed an infrastructure investment project pipeline worth US $23.2bn in network industries such as energy, water, transport and telecommunications. This includes the rehabilitation of the N1, N2 and N3 highways, the student housing infrastructure programme, and the Mokolo and Crocodile River water project,” said president Ramaphosa.

Working with development finance institutions, the government has put together an innovative process that will fund the bulk sewerage, electricity, water, digital infrastructure and roads that will be the foundation of the new city. It will not only be smart and 5G ready, but will be a leading benchmark for green infrastructure, he said.

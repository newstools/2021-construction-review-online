Plans have been unveiled for the construction of the first 3D printed school in Madagascar, particularly in the city of Fianarantsoa, a city (commune urbaine) in the south-central region and the capital of Haute Matsiatra Region of the East African country. Dubbed “Hut v1.0”, the project has been presented by Thinking Huts, a non-profit organization founded by Maggie Grout that is creating innovative solutions to address education infrastructure issues of insufficient space to accommodate students in developing countries.

Featuring 3D printed walls, as per the design, each hut will have a secure door, operating windows, and internet access. Externally, the hybrid design features a vertical farm and solar panels, while the interior will accommodate desks, chairs, and tables. Importantly, multiple pod configurations allow for easy expansion in the future.  eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1','ezslot_7',612,'0','0']));To construct each unit, an architectural scale printer will extrude the construction material, building the walls from the ground up, layer by layer. The Thinking Huts team says that 3D printing decreases construction time from months to days while reducing the project’s carbon footprint. “Our cement mixture is able to withstand environmental pressure and will emit less CO2 compared to traditional concrete.” The finished school will be a hybrid of 3D printed walls and locally-sourced materials for the construction of roofs, doors, and windows.

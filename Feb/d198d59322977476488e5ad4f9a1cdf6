The plant will reportedly be the biggest power plant in the West African country upon completion, with the capacity to generate approximately 25 percent of the power consumed in the country, providing the equivalent electricity needed to power up to 500,000 homes. It will allow the country to increase its power and move closer to its goal of achieving universal access to energy by 2025. The country recorded a rural electrification rate of 53.9% back in 2019 after giving access to energy to 11% of rural households between 2018 and 2019.

The Namibian Power Corporation (Nampower), Namibia’s national power utility that operates under the Southern Africa country’s Ministry of Mines and Energy, has launched a market sounding exercise for the proposed 50 MW Luderitz Wind IPP Power Project. With this procedure, the national power utility aims to solicit market information from interested parties such as developers, financiers, engineers, lenders, companies specializing in the operation and maintenance of power plants, regulators, and consumers. To participate in this procedure, interested parties can access the market sounding documentation and questionnaire survey by visiting the NamPower website following an online registration process at www.nampower.com.na. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));Submissions should be made via email (windmarketsounding@nampower.com.na. )before the 8th day of March this year. It should be noted that this is not the beginning of a bidding process, nor a prequalification exercise for the development of the Luderitz Wind IPP Power Project. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_5',117,'0','0']));Nampower hopes that this procedure will make it possible to make the best decisions for the implementation/development of the power project.

The new regional Mbezi Bus Terminal in Tanzania is set to be launched on the 25th of February. Major construction works on the US $23m project have been completed and buses are expected to start operations anytime. Construction of a pedestrian bridge is nearing completion. The facility will accommodate 700 buses and 80 small vehicles. It will also have outside parking capacity for 1,000 vehicles. According to Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Aboubakar Kunenge, despite the challenges faced on roads to the terminal, the works have been completed and the terminal is ready for operations. Operations were expected to begin from last month but due to road challenges, it was postponed.

On the other hand, a member of the executive committee of the Tanzania Bus Owners Association (Taboa), Mr Mustafa Mwalongo, said they were ready to move to the new facility. “We have no problems because Ubungo is currently a small area and we are not doing our businesses effectively. Major challenges were on entrance road, ticket offices and the parking area which is now said to be ready,” he said. Mr Awadhi Simba, a resident in the area, said some lodges have been upgraded around the terminal with some investors building modern apartments and hotels.

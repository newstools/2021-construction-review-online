According to Hassane, the drinking water supply project in Kana is a component of a vast program namely the Semi-Urban Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Program (PAEPA SU MR) that is being implemented in several phases in eleven regions of the Central African country, where water access rates are below 60%. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_0',117,'0','0']));These regions include Borkou, Ennedi, Tibesti, Mayo Kebbi Ouest, Mayo Kebbi Est, Tandjilé, Logone Oriental, Logone Occidental, Mandoul, Moyen Chari, Salamat, and Sila where water access rates are 19%, 8%, 5%, 13%, 22%, 31%, 27%, 16%, 39%, 42%, 40%, and 27% respectively. The program is co-financed by the Chadian State and the African Development Bank Group (AfDB), a multilateral development finance institution that is also known as Banque Africaine de Développement (BAD) in french, and whose mission is to help reduce poverty, improve living conditions for Africans and mobilize resources for the continent’s economic and social development. The implementation of this program should help improve national drinking water coverage, which is currently estimated at 50% according to the authorities of this Central African country. Back in 2019, 61% of Chad’s population lacked access to basic water services.

This, the Libyan electricity company responsible for the accomplishment of the projects of operating and servicing the electric networks, stations of energy production and their distribution and transformation stations, said that it is in order to meet the growing energy demand of the population. The construction of the proposed gas-fired power plant is expected to take place within the next five months, at an estimated to cost US$ 134m or it’s thereabouts.

As part of its policy to improve the North African country’s electricity supply, GECOL and National Oil Corporation (NOC), the national oil company of Libya held a meeting in Tripoli earlier this month, to discuss means of cooperation between the two sides, in order to supply power plants in different parts of the country. Lack of security and the lack of approval of the budgets necessary to address the energy deficit faced by citizens however, constitute an obstacle to the good continuity of supply operations. Alternative energy projects such as solar energy could therefore open up new perspectives for the Libyan electricity company in its quest to deliver electrical energy at low cost.

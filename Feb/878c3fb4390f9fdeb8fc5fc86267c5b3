Egyptian Transport Minister Kamel al-Wazir announced last month that the total implementation rate of construction and finalization reached 76.5%. According to him, around 1,200m of railways were completed in the sector between Adly Mansour and al-Obour stations with 960m done in the sector between the Badr and New Heliopolis stations. The electric train project extends for a length of 90km, connecting and sharing passenger exchange services with the third line of the subway (Adly Mansour – Cairo University) at the Adly Mansour Station. It will also connect with the Administrative Capital Monorail in the Administrative Capital Station 2, and with the high-speed electric train Alamein/Ain Sokhna in the Administrative Capital’s station.

The project line guarantees speedy transportation between Cairo and the new cities (Obour – Mostakbal – Shorouk – New Heliopolis – Badr – Industrial Zone and the 10th of Ramadan – the New Administrative Capital).

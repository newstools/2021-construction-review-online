The government through the Council of Ministers has formalized the cable transport project in Madagascar with which it intends to establish 274 cable car cabins in Antananarivo, the capital city of the East African country. This project was hinted at by Andry Rajoelina, the president of Madagascar during his end-of-year speech, where he cited the prospects and challenges to be launched for 2021. He said, “This is another way to fight against the traffic jams which have paralyzed the growth of capital. We should and we must reform and modernize transport in Antananarivo.” The cable transport project involves the establishment of two main cable car lines in the Urban Commune of Antananarivo. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','1'])); .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}The first line dubbed the “red line” will connect Anosy-Ambatobe while the second line dubbed the “yellow line” will connect Anosy-Ambanidia. 274 cable car cabins, with the capacity to accommodate 10 to 12 people each, will run on these lines which will have 8 stations.

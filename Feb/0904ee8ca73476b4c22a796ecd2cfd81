Besides providing access to better healthcare, the facility will also offer employment opportunities to residents and professionals across the county. Jonathan Ino, the Busia County Public Health Officer, the construction of this facility is part of the County Government’s objective of ensuring residents who have been experiencing challenges, especially children and expectant mothers get health services near them. He added that it is also in line with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s agenda on the implementation of Universal Health Coverage. Universal health coverage is one of the Kenyatta administration’s big four agenda and its aim is to achieve 100% universal health coverage by upscaling National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) uptake across the East African Country.

According to Jonathan Amoako-Baah, the executive director of GRIDCo, this funding represents a significant contribution to the company’s/countries quest to remain a leader in electrical transmission in the sub-region. “Our long-standing relationship with the European Union (EU) through AFD continues to be invaluable in the supply of quality electricity in West Africa in accordance with Sustainable Development Goal 7”, he affirmed. Ghana exports energy to all of its neighbors. Its electrical power has indeed increased from 1,652 MW in 2000 to 5,172 MW in 2019.

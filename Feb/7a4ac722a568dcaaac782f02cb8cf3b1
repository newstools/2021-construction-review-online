The terminal modernization project was halted and delayed for nearly one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Design and construction documents for the new terminal are ready for bidding. Documents for a new parking garage and rental car facility could be ready by the end of February, according to the airport. Bid packages for the new terminal could be ready to go out in March, starting with structural steel, followed by foundations and underground utilities. The packages represent an estimated US$182 million combined.

The new infrastructure will include a roadway that serves the terminal as well as a multi-level parking garage and ground transportation center. According to Paul Hoback, the airport’s chief development officer, heavy construction will begin in June 2021 if all goes according to plan, and the project is set to be completed by 2024. The new terminal will then open in 2025. “We’ve had amazing partnership from the airlines, and they are stamping their vote of confidence in us through an approval process that will allow us to move the project forward.” eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','1']));Bill Peduzzi, aviation director at HDR, which is part of the program’s design team stated that “This project has been a great example of the importance of collaboration, as we looked outside traditional airport design to also tap the expertise of our HDR colleagues in health care and biocontainment design. Developing a passenger experience that promotes wellness will be key for airports as the world continues to grapple with concerns about health.”

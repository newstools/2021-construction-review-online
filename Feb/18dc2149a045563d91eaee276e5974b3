The current manufacturing plant is divided into two separate manufacturing operations. One part of the plant focuses solely on fabricating foam products for the Company’s Flexible Foam Division, which provides foam products used in packaging, furniture, medical, and many other industries. The other side of the plant produces a variety of products used in the construction industry to help erosion control and sediment runoff products as part of American Excelsior’s Earth Science Division.

This will allow the Company to use the current 76,882 square feet building to produce and warehouse products for the Earth Science Division. Over the past year, both divisions have experienced strong growth, which has resulted in the need for additional equipment. It became crystal clear that operating out of one building was no longer reasonable, so instead of moving the operation to a new location, the decision was made to build another manufacturing plant on the land the Company already owns in Norwalk. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','1']));The General Manager of the Norwalk plant, Casey Poignon, stated that “We have experienced strong growth over the past couple of years and we have simply outgrown our current building. We are excited to develop a workable plan to build on the current property, as it prevents us from relocating. Our associates help make the difference in the markets we serve and expanding right here in Norwalk is a win-win for us, our associates, and the local community.”

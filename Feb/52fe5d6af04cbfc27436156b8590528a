CRS projects include the Okpoama Cottage Hospital, Iseleama Health Centre, and Okpoama Community Water Works. The 2,000 bpd modular refinery project is the fourth of its kind to be supported by the NCDMB under the Federal Government’s plan to use modular refineries to drive the development of the Niger Delta region. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_0',117,'0','0']));The NCDMB had injected equity capital funds in three other modular refineries including the 5,000 bpd Waltersmith modular refinery at Ibigwe, in Imo state, which is already in operation. Others are the 12,000 bpd Hydroskimming modular refinery currently under construction at Obunagha, Gbarain, Bayelsa, by Azikel Petroleum Ltd., and the 2,500 bpd modular refinery being developed by Duport Midstream Company as part of its Energy Park in Egbokor, Edo states. This project will ensure value addition to the crude oil, growing domestic refining capacity to improve product availability, create jobs in-country and curb pipeline vandalism.

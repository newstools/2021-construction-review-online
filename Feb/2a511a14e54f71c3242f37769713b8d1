The new facility on the new Cotton Creek Solar Energy Center in northern Escambia County is part of several new solar farms Gulf Power is building across the Florida Panhandle, in addition to the four solar farms that are already up and running; three of which are run by a private company on military bases, including a 366-acre solar farm at Naval Air Station Pensacola’s Saufley Field. The new Gulf Power solar farm will provide between 200 and 250 construction jobs while being built and provide between US$250,000 and US$300,000 annually in new tax revenue for Escambia County.

Gulf Power spokeswoman, Kimberly Blair, said it is unlikely the solar plant at Saufley Field, the Cotton Creek Solar Energy Center will be built and operated solely by Gulf Power. “We’re leveraging all of Florida Power & Light’s expertise and their track record of building these solar energy centers in other parts of Florida.” eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','1'])); .medrectangle-4-multi-115{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:15px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:15px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}The company is planning an additional solar farm in northern Escambia County called the First City Solar Energy Center as well as one in Santa Rosa County called the Blackwater River Solar Energy Center.

The implementation of the second phase of the Obetsebi-Lamptey Interchange project in Ghana has begun. This phase consists of the construction of the third tier flyover from the Abossey Okai Central Mosque side of the Abossey Okai road towards the STC Yard. It also includes the construction or other continuation of the construction of underground storm drains from the Graphic Road all the way to Mpamprom, near Kaneshie.

FAS Consult Ltd, a Ghanaian multi-disciplinary consultancy firm that provides high-quality technical and professional services to the public and private sectors, will be the project consultants. The first phase of the Obetsebi-Lamptey Interchange project was completed in November last year, five months ahead of schedule. At a cost of approximately US$ 35m, this phase involved the construction of the second tier interchange from the Graphic Road towards Kaneshie; east to west. It also involved the construction of two (5 x 2 meter) 550-meter viaducts and ramps between the Graphic Road and the Dr. Busia Highway (Kaneshie-Mallam Road). With the opening of the second tier flyover to traffic last year, the gridlock which often occurred in the area has reduced. The contract for the design and the construction of the interchange and other ancillary works was signed back in October 2016.

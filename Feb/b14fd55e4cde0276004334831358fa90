The transmission substation will provide electric service to Ultium Cells, an EV battery-cell manufacturing plant jointly backed by General Motors and South Korea’s LG Chem. The company’s 3 million-square-foot facility is expected to bring approximately 1,000 jobs to the area. In addition to supporting Ultium Cells, the new substation and line will also strengthen the regional transmission system. The foundation work is already in the works with steel structures having to be erected at the new substation in Lordstown. Furthermore, crews are completing the construction of a half-mile power line to connect the new substation to an existing 138-kV line located nearby.

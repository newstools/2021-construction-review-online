The Trans-Saharan road, or simply “The Trans-Saharan”, is a 4,800 km road that runs between North Africa (bordered by the Mediterranean Sea in the north), and West Africa (bordered by the Atlantic Ocean in the south), from Algiers in Algeria through Niamey, the capital city of Niger to Lagos in Nigeria to be precise. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_0',117,'0','0']));It is part of the more or less well-defined network project of major trans-African roads linking six countries, which are Algeria, Tunisia, Mali, Niger, Chad, and Nigeria. This project was launched back in the 1960s after which a Liaison Committee was formed to oversee its implementation. According to Mohammed Ayadi, the Secretary-General of the Liaison Committee of the Trans-Saharan Road (CLRT), this project comes as a result of the desire of the Heads of the CLRT member states (Algeria, Tunisia, Niger, Mali, Chad, and Nigeria) to increase the volume of intra-African trade which remains as low as 3%.

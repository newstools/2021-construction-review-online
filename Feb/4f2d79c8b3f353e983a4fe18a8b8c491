This will bring the number of such water infrastructure in service in the North African country to 20 by the year 2027. All the installations will increase the capacity of the dams of the country from a total of 18 billion cubic meters to the equivalent of 27 billion. The water reservoirs will be filled up, for the most part, with rainwater. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1','ezslot_5',612,'0','0']));The Moroccan government also wants to exploit non-conventional water resources, from treatment plants to seawater desalination plants that will be built in the coastal areas of the North African Kingdom. The second axis of the 2020-2027 national drinking water supply and irrigation program will focus on water valorization. Measures to reduce water consumption will also be implemented mainly in the agricultural sector which depends on irrigation. The entire program will be financed by the government of Morocco to the tune of close to US$ 13bn.

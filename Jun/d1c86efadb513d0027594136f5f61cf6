Senegalese President Macky Sall recently chaired the inauguration ceremony of the Carrefour Rn2-Medina Ndiathbé-Cas-Saldé-Pété road, which serves the northern part of the West African country, particularly the island of Morphil, located approximately 490 kilometers from Dakar, in the department of Podor. The 68 kilometers long asphalt road is an integral part of a vast government program whose objective is “to improve the overall level of service of the national road network and to ensure service to remote areas”. According to President Macky Sall, the realization of this road axis, therefore, makes it possible to complete an important part of the opening up of this part of the department of Podor.

The implementation of the New Khartoum international airport project, which was suspended after the fall, on April 2019, of the former Sudanese President, Omar al-Bashir, is set to resume. This is after a meeting held in the North African country by Engineer Mirghani Musa, Sudanese Minister of Transport, and Salim Bora, the chairman of the board of directors of Summa, a global construction company headquartered in Turkey, with diversified interests and operations that won a US$ 1.15bn deal to build the airport in question back in 2018.

On the other hand, the Minister of Transport said that this news is a result of his last visit to Turkey, on May 27 and 28 and that the Sudanese Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok ordered the review of the previously signed memorandum of understanding so that the new Khartoum airport project can see the light of day. The new Khartoum airport will be built approximately 40 kilometers south of Khartoum, the North African country’s capital city. Initially, it was planned that the project would be implemented in three phases the first of which would see the delivery of two 4000 meter runways capable of handling the Airbus A380 double-decker airliner, a 300-room international hotel, and a passenger terminal of 86,000 square meters with an initial capacity of six million passengers per year. In the two subsequent phases, the passenger terminal would be extended to increase its capacity to 9 million and then 12 million. The project was expected to take 36 months from the day it breaks ground to be completed. 100

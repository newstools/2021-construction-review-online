Greengate has retained an ongoing economic interest in the project and will continue to manage local stakeholder relations throughout its operation and construction. The solar farm is expected to go online in 2022. Amazon has also signed a deal to buy up to 400 MW of electricity from the project in addition to the previously announced plans to purchase power from an 80 MW solar farm northeast of High River which should come online in 2023. “Greengate is excited to work together with CIP to bring this one-of-a-kind project to completion. Travers Solar will significantly improve Alberta’s environmental performance, adding to Greengate’s proven track record of successfully developing renewable energy projects of scale in Canada that deliver strong investor returns. Greengate is proud to play a key role in creating market-based solutions that enable the global energy transition to net zero.” said Dan Balaban, Chief Executive Officer of Greengate. “CIP is pleased to continue growing its North American renewable energy portfolio through our investment in Travers Solar, CIP’s first investment in Canada. Alberta is an attractive market for investment, and we look forward to working with Greengate and our local partners to bring this exciting project to completion,” said Senior Partner Christian Skakkebaek of CIP. 87

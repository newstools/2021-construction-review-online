The turbine installation and its auxiliaries will take approximately three months including dynamic balancing. The installation of turbines will run along with other major installations such as Generator Step Up Transformer (GSUT), Auxiliary transformers, MV and LV Switchgears, Non Condensable Gas extraction system, Cooling water system, Air Compressor system, Heating and Ventilation system and Emergency Diesel Generator. “With these activities running concurrently, it will ensure that the power plant’s commissioning is achieved in the last quarter of the year 2021,” said Miano. Construction of Olkaria 1 AU 6 geothermal power plant started in 2018 with a ground breaking ceremony, graced by President Uhuru Kenyatta. The project is aligned with KenGen’s long term strategy and the Least Cost Power Development Plan (LCPDP) focused on sustainable supply of renewable energy in support of the Government Big Four Agenda. Upon completion, the power plant will generate 83.3MW of electricity which will be injected into the national grid. 85%

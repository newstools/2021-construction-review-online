Speaking during the groundbreaking ceremony, President Museveni recalled that the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo and those of the Republic of Uganda are linked and have existed as neighbors from time immemorial, and noted that the project will bring about a considerable socio-economic transformation of the lives of the inhabitants of the two nations. Upon completion, this project could also double trade in Uganda, a country that makes about US$ 532M a year from trading with DRC where it exports goods such as plastics, clothing, and food products produced by domestic industries. In DRC, the project is expected to improve interconnectivity and security particularly in the eastern region, where reportedly a number of rebel groups operate from.

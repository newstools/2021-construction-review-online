The residents have for years complained of poor road network in the area. The road has been in a deplorable state for decades inconveniencing thousands of residents residing in the area. Mr Mucheke noted that the road will open up the vast remote areas of Juja constituency predicting that most investors who had purchased land in the region will now develop their parcels leading to massive growth of the region’s economy. “Many land buyers have been waiting for the road to be constructed and with this new development, we expect them to move in and develop their lands. Some will settle as residents while others will put up industries. The population will significantly grow and so will the economy,” said Mucheke. “Our farmers especially in Juja Farm and Athi who usually sustain the Juja and Witeithie markets will easily transport their farm produce to the markets. We are grateful for this development,” the MCA added. 82

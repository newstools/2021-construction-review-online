Other works include the construction of a concrete-lined canal, a hydroelectric power plant, a secondary power plant, and a transmission line. The implementation of the project began in 2018 and it was expected to be operational in 2023. However, due to work delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the Nachtigal dam is now expected to enter into commercial exploitation (commissioning of all of its seven plants) in March 2024, four months after the initial schedule. 100

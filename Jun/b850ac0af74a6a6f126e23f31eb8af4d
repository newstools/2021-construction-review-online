Delivered in record time, with just 18 months between the signing of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and commencement of commercial operations, the power plant is the country’s first utility-scale renewable energy project developed by an Independent Power Producer (IPP) i.e. AMEA Power, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi-based conglomerate AlNowais Investments, and one of the largest solar PV IPP plants in the West African region. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};The Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed solar power plant project was supported with concessional loans from the West African Development Bank (BOAD) and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD). It was pre-funded on a balance sheet and then refinanced. This is a unique model for large-scale IPP projects in the African continent. It is indicative of the level of project certainty created by the NDP’s regulatory framework, which provided AMEA Power with the necessary level of assurance and comfort to embark on the project’s execution well in advance of the financing being arranged.

The 9% energy is reportedly enough to meet the electricity demand in the said area. The power plant is also instrumental in supporting Togo’s US$ 8bn 2018 – 2022 National Development Plan (NDP), with which it aims to achieve universal access to electricity by 2030 and to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix to 50%. Furthermore, the power plant will save more than 1 million tonnes of CO2 emissions over the course of its life. 91

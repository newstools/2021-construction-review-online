The three buildings Ngando Mpondo complex will be constructed on a 6 hectares piece of land. It will include amphitheaters, classrooms, and other University structures that will make teaching and learning conducive for both lecturers and students. It is worth mentioning that currently the University of Douala has old and dilapidating buildings, with some obsolete equipment that are no longer in use, and crowded amphitheaters and classrooms that are not comfortable for the learning process. The new Ngando Mpondo complex will be delivered in November this year after approximately five months of construction. 91

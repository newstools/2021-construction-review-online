The upgrade will involve two major construction projects including an US$8.3 million renovation of the garage, funding for this renovation was awarded by the Federal Aviation Administration who offered US$12 million in grants to cover part of the cost to expand the road leading to Eppley’s terminals. The entrance to the terminal will be moved about a quarter-mile to the south, said Steve McCoy, chief information and development officer for the Omaha Airport Authority. Traffic lanes, stoplights, and signage will be added, along with improved lighting and landscaping.

Work on the South Garage at the Eppley Airfield will include the construction of an express ramp that will provide access to premier parking. The project also includes the installation of energy-efficient lighting and wider parking stalls. New signage is intended to make driving through the garage more convenient and efficient. Both the terminal and South Garage will be open during construction, although drivers may encounter occasional minor detours or closures. Parking customers are encouraged to use the new North Garage, which has an entrance off Abbott Drive. “We know that’s important, not only to travelers but the general community as well,” Steve McCoy, OAA’s chief information and development officer, said. “All of the construction, whether it’s on the roadway or the garage, is going to be phased. Both the garage and the roadway will remain open at all times,” he added. “Over the last seven days, we’re about 80 percent of the pre-pandemic passenger numbers,” McCoy said. 85

The 25km road will start from Tshesebe junction on Francistown – Ramokgwebana A1 section, traverse through Mosojane, and end at the junction with the Sebina – Zwenshambe tarred road in Masunga village. “Upon termination of the initial contractor, the ministry also parted ways with the consultant to allow the legal process to take its cause. The ministry is in consultations with Department of Mines to facilitate acquisition of aggregates for sourcing gravel by the new contractor to eliminate delays once construction is in motion,” said Mr Segokgo. Meanwhile Mr Segokgo has attributed delays on other roads such as Ramokgwebana-Mulambakwena road, which was supposed to have been completed to budgetary constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The project is currently halfway. “Due to COVID-19, there was shortage of cement countrywide which has delayed many projects. Some minor projects such as construction of culverts and re- gravelling were deferred. Additionally heavy rains experienced in the North East District during the past season forced contractors to suspend work in the area,” said Mr Segokgo. 86

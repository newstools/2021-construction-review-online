Construction on a new US$1.5 million resiliency project has begun in New York as announced by Governor Andrew Cuomo. The project, in Cayuga County, is aimed at improvements to the existing double culvert carrying McIntyre Road over Sterling Valley Creek which is the only access route for local residences and agricultural properties north of Sterling Creek and was damaged by the flooding events of 2019 which caused the inundation of the culvert and erosion of the roadway embankment at both the inlet and the outlet of the culvert. The project, through the New York Resiliency and Economic Development Initiative, will ensure uninterrupted residential and emergency vehicle passage.

We will not simply repair affected infrastructure; we will reimagine and build back more resilient, better, and stronger,” said Governor Cuomo. “Communities along Lake Ontario have faced devastating flooding in recent years due to the effects of climate change. New York is leading the way to help them build back stronger for the future,” said Kathy Hochul, the Lieutenant Governor. “The resiliency project starting in the Town of Sterling, and recently completed in Little Sodus Bay, will not only protect against future flooding but also improve public safety on critical roadways and boost tourism by ensuring safe recreational access for boaters.” 81%

The US$898.6 million station will directly connect Los Angeles International Airport to the region’s light rail and bus transportation systems. The station will have platforms to access Metro light-rail trains, a 16-bay bus plaza for Metro and municipal buses, a private vehicle bicycle zone, a drop-off zone, and commercial space. The project is designed to be up and running in time for the 2028 Olympics. But more importantly, some officials see it as a potential turning point in Los Angeles’ ambitious, expensive efforts to make mass transit a serious alternative in a city known for its cars.

Visitors and residents in Los Angeles have complained for a long time about the city’s lack of a direct rail connection to the airport, the second-busiest airport in the nation. One 2018 study of transit access at U.S. airports ranked it near the bottom. “This won’t just be the site of our new Crenshaw/LAX line station. We’re going to have a bus plaza here, with electric bus charging stations, because by 2030 all Metro buses will be electric and emissions-free. We’ll have a dedicated drop-off area here so you never have to go into that horseshoe unless you really want to see the theme building.” said the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti during the ground-breaking ceremony. “This is one of many projects that Measure M, the largest transportation initiative at the local level in American history times two, is doing throughout our county, including 15 transit lines that are either extending or building new, including the Crenshaw/LAX Line that will connect here and that will open very soon,” he added. 89%

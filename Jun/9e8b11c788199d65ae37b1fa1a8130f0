The Redstone concentrated solar power project is being developed by a consortium of SolarReserve-a leading energy solution provider in Africa, and ACWA Power-a developer, investor, and operator of power generation and desalinated water production plants, on a 648 hectares piece of land in the Humansrus Solar Park located towards the east of Postmasburg, Northern Cape Province. The 100MW project has a 250m-tall central receiver tower with a 12-hour full-load energy storage capacity that allows for the storage of heat energy harvested from the sun. The tower employs ThermaVault technology which combines solar thermal technology with molten salt energy storage technology. This feature enables energy dispatch after sunset and provides energy supply during peak demand periods, helping to prevent power interruptions and load shedding. Upon completion, the project will provide approximately 200,000 South African households with clean and reliable energy and help to offset around 480,000 tons of carbon per year – equivalent to the per capita emissions of 67,000 South Africans. 100

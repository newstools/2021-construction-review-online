The heat park concept is an approach where, apart from power generation, geothermal energy is used in industrial heating and for recreational and leisure.

A heat park offering reliable and affordable energy will create jobs and boost the economy of the region,” said Mr Jared Othieno. Mr Othieno spoke during a tour of the project accompanied by German Development Bank (KFW) officials. KFW is financing the first phase of the Baringo-Silali geothermal project at a cost of US $93m. The Baringo-Silali block is estimated to have a potential of 3,000 MW. For the first phase, GDC aims at developing 300 MW by 2030 at the Paka, Korosi and Silali fields. GDC recently struck a well at Paka Hills, boosting its quest to develop geothermal energy in the country. Meanwhile, Nakuru County is banking on geothermal power to drive its industrial revolution. Nakuru County hopes to rely on geothermal energy to power its economy at a time when the drive to turn Naivasha to a major economic hub in Kenya and East Africa is gathering pace. 83

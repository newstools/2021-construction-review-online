The upgrade project for El Atf and Sidi Krir Power Plants in Egypt, located approximately 80km east of Alexandria on the Nile delta, and at the Mediterranean Sea coast approximately 50km west of Alexandria city respectively, is over 80% complete. This achievement, alongside the conclusion of the new Long-Term Service and Supply Agreement for three power stations in Middle Delta, West Delta, and North Cairo, executed by Mitsubishi Power, was recently celebrated by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The ceremony was attended by Gaber Dessouki, chairman of the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company, on behalf of Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy Mohamed Shaker, and Ambassador of Japan to Egypt NOKE Masaki as well as the CEO of Mitsubishi Power Europe Carlos Peton. Also present was representatives from West Delta Electricity Production Company, which operates the Sidi Krir complex as a subordinate of the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company, and officials from the competent Egyptian authorities. Both El-Atf and Sidi Krir Power Plants run on natural gas-fired gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) generators with a rated output of 750MW and two M701F gas turbines.

This will as a result contribute to economic and social development and climate change mitigation in the North African country. The El-Atf and Sidi Krir Power Plants upgrade project is being undertaken under the framework of the Electricity Sector’s Rehabilitation and Improvement Project, which is financed by JICA with an amount totaling around US$ 400M. 100

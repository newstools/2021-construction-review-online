As Minister of Petroleum Resources back in 1978, I kicked off Nigeria’s first foray in the LNG Business and we have not looked back ever since.“ Also Read: Drilling works at Elon field offshore Block G in Equatorial Guinea, starts “I am very delighted that we have reached yet another milestone today, under my watch. We will continue to deliver on and enable transformational public and private sector projects of this nature to the people of this nation,” said the West African country’s president. Upon completion, the project will increase the capacity of NLNG’s current six-Train plant by 35% from the extant 22 Million Tonnes Per Annum (mtpa) to 30mtpa. The Nigeria LNG Train 7 project is speared by Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG), a joint venture between the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and international oil majors Royal Dutch Shell, ENI, and Total. NLNG took the Final Investment Decision (FID) in December 2019, which was followed by the approval of the Nigerian Content Compliance Certificate (NCCC) and Approved Vendors Lists (AVLs) by the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) in April last year. In May 2020, NLNG awarded the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) Contracts for its Train 7 Project to SCD JV Consortium, comprising affiliates of Saipem, Chiyoda, and Daewoo, a step that triggered the commencement of the Detail Design and Construction phase of the Project. 97

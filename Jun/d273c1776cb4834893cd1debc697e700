Harvesting energy from a star is the business that Go-Pure.EU currently conducts They capture solar photons in photovoltaic fields,And by their transformation to alternate current they are able to produce pure electricity. This system consists of PV modules, ground-mounting systems, DC cables, DC string boxes, and a central inverter with a transformator. The system is designed to be connected to the grid. This system consists of PV modules, ground-mounting systems, DC cables, inverters, AC cables, DC/AC boxes, island inverters and multi-cluster boxes. The system is designed to be installed in a place with no grid connection. The island inverters create their own grid and supply consumers. This system consists of PV modules, ground-mounting systems, DC cables, DC string boxes, central inverters with transformers and systems with a fuel save controller. This systemâ€™s design suits installation into the local grid with existing fuel generator units. The fuel save controller manages the performance of fuel generators according to the grid demand and the power supply from the PV system. Fuel generators are used only if the PV system does not produce enough electricity.

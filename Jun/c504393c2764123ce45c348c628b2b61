The operation and maintenance of the future Ndjolé hybrid solar power plant shall be carried out by the Société d’énergie et d’eau du Gabon (the energy and water company of Gabon-Seeg), under a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) signed with the Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations du Gabon, a financial institution, created as a public industrial and commercial establishment. The Ndjolé hybrid solar power plant is one of the hybrid projects launched as part of the first phase of the zero diesel program which involves the construction of 8 solar power plants with a cumulative capacity of 2.2 MW. In addition to Ndjolé, five more plants will be installed in the province of Ogooué Ivindo, particularly in the localities of Bitam, Makokou, Ovan, Mékambo, and Booué. This will have a total of (850 kW). Two more will be built in Minvoul and Medouneu, in the province of Woleu Ntem. This project is expected to reduce electricity production costs by 30% in the beneficiary communities and also help save approximately one million liters of fuel oil per year, avoiding the emission of 2,600 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) over the same period.

The project will also see the upgrade, rehabilitation, and extension of 1,720 kilometers of low voltage network, and distribution of transformers in secondary cities with high load. Upon completion, the project is looked forward to improving the reliability and stability of the power supply across the country, expand electricity access and contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by enabling access to clean energy. Furthermore, it is expected to bolster education by extending students’ access to light for study, and benefit small and medium enterprises while enhancing job creation for the youth. This electrification project is a part of the Universal Access to Energy Program in Rwanda (RUEAP), which aims to achieve universal access to electricity by 2024. Other than helping advance the East African country’s efforts of universal electrification by 2024 the project will also benefit small businesses and youth in the region.

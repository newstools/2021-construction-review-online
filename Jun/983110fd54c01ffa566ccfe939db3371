Thiba Dam project in Kenya is set to be operational by December this year. Project Engineer, Stephen Mutinda made the announcement and said the project will be ready to control flood waters and provide water for irrigation. The engineer explained that the project experienced delays following the delay in the approval of the master list which took nine months, translating to slow mobilisation by the contractor and in the payment of duties, taxes and levies resulting to a halt “Immersing of the facility with water would commence immediately in readiness to provide irrigation water to rice farmers in Mwea,” said Engineer Mutinda.

The dam will be 40m tall and 1km long and a holding capacity of 15 million cubic meters Thiba Dam is expected to boost rice production in the giant Mwea Irrigation Scheme in Kirinyaga County by providing irrigation water to the scheme which produces over 60% of rice grown in Kenya. Other crops such as vegetables and maize will also be produced. The Irrigation Scheme currently has 25,000 acres under rice cultivation but upon expansion will add up to 35,000 acres, which will translate to double production of paddy rice. According to the Kenya Bureau of Statistics shows that Kenya imports rice every year largely from Pakistan, Thailand, India and Vietnam. Completion of the dam will cut the amount used for import by half if it succeeds in increasing water supply, to allow for three seasons of rice per year, unlike the current one season. “As from next year upon being handed over, rice production in Mwea will double from the current 120,000 metric tons to about 250,000 metric tons due to the double cropping,” said Mr. Karanja. 90%

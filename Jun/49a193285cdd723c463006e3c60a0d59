It is also supported by Oman’s State General Reserve Fund. China Merchants Holdings International, China’s largest port operator and Tanzania signed a framework agreement to construct the port and a special economic zone which seeks to transform the country into a regional trade and transport hub. The port, to be built 75 KM North Dar Es Salaam will connect with Kenya’s Mombasa port which is 300 KM away and will include an industrial zone, link roads and rail transport. Construction works include building of a 34 kilometer road joining Bagamoyo and Mlandizi and 65 kilometers of railway connecting Bagamoyo with the Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA) and Central Railway. The mega project is estimated to take about 30 years to construct to reach its full potential. The port will be able to handle twenty times more cargo than the port in the Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam, the country’s largest port. 84

It also consists of the expansion of a distribution network operation which includes rural electrification and last-mile connections. The funds will be used to construct the plant and an evacuation transmission line, as well as to add 4,250 rural electrification connections for households, schools, clinics and small and medium-sized enterprises in the Kigoma Region. The project’s overall cost is estimated at US $144.14M. The government of Tanzania will provide the remaining US$ 4.14M. The project is expected to create about 700 jobs during the phase of construction, cut the region’s electricity generation costs to about $0.04/kWh from the current $0.33/kWh upon completion, and reduce reliance on greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels. The Malagarasi Hydropower project aligns with Tanzania’s National Development Vision 2025 and its Second Five-Year Development Plan (2016/17 – 2020/21). It also complements other regional initiatives, including the North West Grid 400-kV Nyakanazi-Kigoma transmission line project, which the AfDB is financing together with the South Korea Economic Development Co-operation Fund, administered by the Export-Import Bank of Korea and the Ministry of Strategy and Finance. 85

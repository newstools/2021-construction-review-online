According to officials, the new terminal’s nature-infused interiors, expanded spaces give PDX the flexibility to adapt to new technologies and earthquake-resilient structure that will welcome the growing number of passengers expected in the coming decades. “We’re taking the airport that has served the region well for the past 80 years and updating and upgrading it. While the area will look and feel different, we are keeping the heart and soul of the airport that Portlanders know and love that will be easy to navigate; bright, open spaces; and local shops and restaurants. It will still feel like home.” said Vince Granato, the chief projects officer. With forests covering nearly half the state of Oregon, the Cascades stretching north and south, and a sweeping coastline, nature is everywhere. The architects are bringing elements of the great outdoors to Portland International Airport in this upgrade through features such as the regionally and sustainably sourced wooden roof with skylights that will stretch across the expanded lobby and ticket areas. 81

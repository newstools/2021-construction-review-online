The Federal government of Nigeria plans to sell electrical power to the neighboring republics of Togo, Burkina Faso, Benin, and Niger through the proposed West African Power Pool (WAPP) North Core project. This was made public by Sule Abdulaziz, the acting managing director of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) and the chairman of the executive board of the WAPP. He explained that the power that will be sold through the North Core will be the surplus power in Nigeria. “The energy that we are going to sell is the energy that is not needed in our country. The power generators that will power this transmission line will generate this energy specifically for this project. It is therefore unused energy, “he said adding that the initiative will benefit the West African Country in terms of revenue and job creation. The North-Core Project involves the construction of approximately 875 kilometers of 330 kV and 24 kilometers of 225 kV transmission lines from Birnin Kebbi in Nigeria to Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso, through Zabori and Niamey in Niger with T-off to Malanville in Benin.

Furthermore, the project involves electrification of rural communities located within a 5 km radius on both sides of the line and the implementation of several environmental and social mitigation measures including Resettlement Action Plans to provide compensation for persons and communities affected by the project among others. 92

The Benoit Group gave a statement featuring what will be in the new development that will be presented to Atlanta’s Zoning Review Board. In a rezoning application filed last month, the developers laid out plans for 360 multifamily units, including 200 apartments and 160 active senior living units, along with 22 for-sale units to be built by Fortas Homes. Of the rental units, 285 will be below market rate at a mix of incomes, while the for-sale units will include five affordable homes, plans show.

The first phase involves the 26-acre former public housing site to the south of Englewood Avenue and next to the Atlanta BeltLine-adjacent Boulevard Crossing Park, with a second phase planned for the north side of Englewood Avenue, also adjacent to the BeltLine. The Benoit Group was chosen to develop a 16-acre western portion of the first phase, while plans called for The Michaels Organization to build on 10 acres to the east. The Benoit Group’s development also involves 27,000 square feet of street-level retail spread around its residential components. Plans call for 200 units and up to 17,000 square feet of retail bounded by Englewood and Climax to the north and south and Mailing Avenue and the new street to the west and east. On this block would also be a new 0.43-acre park and swimming pool, among other additions. Of the 200 multifamily units, 157 would be affordable at a mix of 30 percent, 60 percent, or 80 percent of area median income. The senior living portion would be just east and include up to 21,000 square feet of street-level retail, while the 22 for-sale homes would be just west of the extended Mailing Avenue. 85

Representing a total investment of over US$ 245m, the project arose from the desire to curb losses incurred by the West African country due to the exportation of raw commodities produced, paired with a need to generate added value for the country by investing in local processing. According to Gagan Gupta, the Chief of Arise IIP, owing to the recently launched industrial platform, Togo’s exports should jump in value from US$ 75M to approximately US$ 1bn, a 12-fold increase. “This would be the first increase in value ever witnessed in the continent,” said Gagan Gupta adding that production of soybeans, wood, marble, or electric engines, should also grow enormously. The PIA is expected to create approximately 35,000 direct jobs in the next 48 months and millions of direct and indirect jobs by 2030. 100

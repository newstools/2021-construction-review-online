A 685 km section of the entire pipeline is in Benin. The construction of this section was launched last month with the West Africa Oil Pipeline Bénin Company (WAPCO Bénin), which is a subsidiary of the China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Co. (CNODC), itself a subsidiary of the China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), as the contractor. The construction of the pipeline alongside two pumping stations at Gogounou and Tchatchou in the Alibori and Borgou Departments respectively is expected to be completed in 2023. The entire project entails the construction of a total of nine pumping stations. Upon completion, the Niger-Benin pipeline project will boost Niger’s daily oil production from 20,000 barrels to 100,000 barrels in 2023 and to 200,000 barrels over the long term. It will also allow Benin to become an actor in the oil sector without producing a drop of oil and also help improve the tax revenues of the West African country with annual transit costs of around US$ 30M. 86

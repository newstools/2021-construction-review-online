It is aimed at improving water, health and hygiene in arid and semi-arid parts of the vast county. The CS Kariuki said the first phase of the project is expected to be completed in 18 months. Once fully complete, the dam will be providing potable water to over 40,000 residents from Makamini, Kinagoni, Matumbi, Mtaa, Mabesheni, Bofu, Kibandaongo, Mnyenzeni and Mwamdudu sub locations. “Infrastructure investments are crucial to extend water and sanitation services to more people across the country. We are optimistic that the Makamini Dam project once complete, together with other dams funded by the devolved unit such as the Mwakalanga, Kizingo and Dziweni dams will solve the water scarcity problem facing the people living in the semi-arid areas of the county,” said Governor Mvurya. “The project will also help local people, especially mothers who walk long distances in search of water. It will also reduce cases of sexual abuse among the girls and it will help them concentrate with their studies instead of searching for water,” the Governor added. 85

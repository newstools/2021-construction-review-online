Construction of the Cuamba Solar PV plant in Mozambique has commenced. Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Dr Ernesto Max Tonela performed the ground breaking ceremony and said the project will contribute to the Government’s “Energy for All” strategy, aiming to have universal energy access by 2030. The US $32m project is located in the Tetereane District of the city of Cuamba, Niassa province, about 550 kms west of the coastal town Nacala. It involves construction of a 19MW solar plant, a 2MW energy storage system and an upgrade to the existing Cuamba substation.

Electricity will be sold through a 25-year power purchase agreement with EDM. Cuamba Solar PV plant project will receive US $19m debt funding from the Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund (EAIF), a member of the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG). It will also receive US $7m grant funding from PIDG’s Viability Gap Funding (VGF) grant facility and another US $1m grant from CDC Plus to enable an affordable tariff and the energy storage system. “This project is a trailblazer for future utility-scale energy storage in Mozambique and the region.  Cuamba Solar, along with all our energy projects we are working on, cements our ongoing commitment to contribute to the long-term energy security and development of the country on a low carbon pathway,” said Jonathan Hoffman, Globeleq’s Chief Development Officer. Meanwhile, Globeleq and Source Energia are also developing one of the first wind projects in Mozambique located near the town of Namaacha 40km west of Maputo. 83%

Construction of the largest solar farm in Maine, Milo Solar, a 27MW plant has been completed. The solar farm was developed originally by Dirigo Solar and BNRG Renewables and was sold to Acadia Renewable Energy in 2019, an affiliate of the Carlyle Group. The US$30 million project has created over 170 construction jobs and will power ten thousand houses in the state of Maine with renewable and clean energy. The plant has been estimated to offset approximately 25,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere yearly. Taking up nearly 100 acres of land, the 67,000 solar panels were completed 5 years after construction began.

This town was built by harnessing the power of the three rivers to become the center of our lumber industry. A few decades later, the people of Milo manned shovels and picks to extend railroad service to this part of Maine. Today, they are continuing their commitment to progress by joining their technology partners in helping to lead their town, our State, and our nation into a new era of clean, renewable energy independence. I commend Dirigo Solar, BNRG, Carlyle, and, most of all, the people of Milo for this outstanding accomplishment.” Senator Susan Collins stated. “Solar is a proven tool in the fight against climate change, a global challenge that requires local action, and these new panels stand to protect Maine’s natural resources, our clean air, and water, which are our greatest treasures. In addition, this project demonstrates that renewable energy makes economic sense. The lower utility bills will benefit customers for years to come and help attract new residents and businesses.” the Senator continued. She is a member of the Climate Solutions Caucus and cut the ribbon at the opening ceremony. 86%

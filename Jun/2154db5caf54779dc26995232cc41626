It includes US$80 billion dollars for new trains that would go a long way toward beginning to realize his vision. Amtrak has already stepped up with a massive plan for Biden’s proposed rail dollars that would add dozens of new daily trains and connect 160 additional communities to passenger rail. And private rail operators Brightline in California and Florida, and Texas Central are also eager for any additional federal funds to speed construction of new lines.

Los Angeles is the largest source of inbound visitors to Las Vegas in the U.S., with nearly 1.6 million visitors in 2019, according to Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority data. Brightline hopes to take a sizable share of those visitors who either fly or drive today. Brightline pulled a US$3.2 billion tax-exempt bond sale in late 2020 on low investor appetite, and while Brightline CEO Michael Reininger said a new bond sale that would allow construction to begin is planned for this year, additional federal funds would be welcome and could speed up a future extension into the Los Angeles Basin. Federal funds could also accelerate Brightline’s plans to extend its under-construction rail line between Miami and the Orlando airport onto Disney World and eventually Tampa. Work on the Orlando line passed the halfway mark in May with hopes to open by the end of 2022. “The urgent economic and mobility needs of the nation require a more holistic approach that focuses on quickly improving and expanding our conventional network to serve more people and places with reliable service,” Amtrak CEO William Flynn told a U.S. House of Representatives committee as part of the push for additional funding in May. 81

Acorn Holdings’ approach to real estate investing has evolved from our heritage as an owner and operator, having invested our own capital to develop and operate the initial portfolio of assets that we acquired. To ensure that our interests are aligned with those of our investors, we put our own capital to work alongside theirs in the investment portfolios that we manage. As student numbers grow, Kenya is experiencing a chronic shortage of suitable student accommodation and Acorn is seeking to attract private sector investment from Kenya’s local capital markets in order to achieve its ambitious growth strategy. According to data from Kenya’s Ministry of Education, available student housing in Kenya stood at 300,000 compared to a university enrollment of 520,900 in 2019, excluding technical and vocational education and training colleges. 80

The new terminal will include direct mooring access for large-sized LPG carriers, storage and associated infrastructure that has multiple loading points for the transfer of LPG to road and rail transport. Further, the terminal is tipped to end infrastructure constraints in the LPG value chain and promote the accessibility and affordability of the product. Phase one of the LPG project is set to begin operations within six months while the second phase will set the storage capacity to 22,000 metric tons with an annual throughput capacity of 400,000 metric tons. 82%

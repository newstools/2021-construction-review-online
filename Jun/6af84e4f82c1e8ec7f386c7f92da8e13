The National Assembly Committee on Finance and National Planning in Kenya has proposed to cap the concession period for public-private-partnership (PPP)-funded projects at 30 years.­­­ The committee chaired by Gladys Wanga said that the move is aimed at addressing gaps in the regulatory framework for investors involved in State-owned build-operate-transfer (BoT) projects. The proposal is contained in amendments to the PPP Act, 2013 that are before Parliament for debate and approval. In a BoT model, a government entity grants a private investor the rights or concession to construct and operate a project over an agreed period in exchange for payments. At the end of the contract period, the management of the project is transferred to the government. “A contracting authority shall not enter into a public-private partnership arrangement for a period exceeding thirty years,” said Gladys Wanga.

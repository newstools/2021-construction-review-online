Hotel du Lac is basically a futuristic ultra-modern hotel complex and leisure park. The project comprises the construction of three towers, one of which will have a total of 32 floors with some 350 rooms and a 400 capacity parking lot, and another seven-storey yacht-shaped annex.

The construction works will be carried out over a period of 24 to 30 months by Arabian Construction Company (ACC), a leading construction firm in the MENA region with a portfolio that includes some of the Middle East and India’s most iconic and sophisticated construction masterpieces. The Hotel du Lac project was conceived over half a decade ago. In September 2016, the Cameroonian Minister of the Economy Louis Paul Motaze signed a financing agreement with Deutsche Bank Spain, to begin the redevelopment of the lake and its surroundings. The work was then scheduled to start in 2017 and end in 2019. It was however suspended indefinitely, following a unilateral modification of the project by the Presidency. In September 2019, Henri Eyebe Ayissi signed a collaboration agreement in Yaoundé with Elfallahi Rahima Dina, Africa director of the Belgian consortium IIDG / Hotel Group, and Franck Marie Ronald Smolders, manager of IIDG and co-manager of the company ” Cameroun Hôtels et Résidences SARL “, for the construction implementation of the project. In November of the same year, a new loan agreement was signed between Cameroon and the Deutsche Bank of Spain for the project. 100

The government of France through AFD financed the feasibility study of the grid project through a grant and an additional US$ 848,960 has been committed for assisting in the technical assistance of the project. According to the Permanent Secretary of the Tanzanian Ministry of Finance and Planning, upon completion, the project will increase the security of power supply, and enable Tanesco to fulfill its target of diversifying energy generation resources with a renewable power generation mix. The project will reduce dependence on Hydropower during daylight hours and allow conservation of generation capacity thus allowing spare capacity to be used during peak demand periods and extensive dry season. For the Shinyanga region, in particular, the project will enhance the ability to supply to the adjacent gold mines as well as stabilize the grid to strengthen power supply capacity and stimulate the economic and social development in the said region. 100

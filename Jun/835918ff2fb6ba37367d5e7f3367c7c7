The Fort Bend Solar Farm is ACCIONA’s first solar farm in the United States as the company plans to double its renewable energy capacity in the United States with the addition of more than 1,200 MW of solar photovoltaic energy by the end of 2023. ACCIONA will invest US$280 million in the Fort Bend solar plant. The plant will have a significant economic impact on Fort Bend County, where the solar plant is located, with the creation of up to 450 jobs during peak construction, and millions in annual tax payments to the county and local school districts. The Fort Bend Solar plant will begin operation in 2022.

ACCIONA also purchased a 240 MW solar farm in the same area recently from Diode Venture. With three wind power projects in Cameron County, Texas, the Fort Bend project represents Acciona’s fourth investment in the state and its first solar PV project in Texas. When operational, Fort Bend will give the company more than 750 MW of renewable capacity in Texas. “We are excited to invest in Fort Bend County and to bring this solar project forward. This is an opportunity to continue our success in the State of Texas. The Fort Bend project will be a flagship of our US portfolio and a demonstration of our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders while advancing economic development and sustainability. The start of construction of Fort Bend is a milestone in ACCIONA’s history in the United States, as it is our first PV project in the country,” said Joaquín Castillo, CEO of Acciona’s energy division in North America. 87

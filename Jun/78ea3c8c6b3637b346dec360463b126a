This project favours an integrated approach to solving the problems that hamper the development of the agricultural and agro-industrial sector, particularly the supply of water. Rice consumes far more water than any other cereal. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), this water is used for evapotranspiration, infiltration and drainage, specific water management before tillage and drainage before tillering. Rice production is practiced by about 8% of the country’s population. The average farm size is about 0.8 ha in upland and 0.3 ha in irrigated rice. Upland rice is generally grown as a mono-crop or as in a mixture with other food crops following the slash-and-burn shifting cultivation almost without any application of chemical fertilizer and other ago-chemical. The low percentage is as a result of lack of appropriate tools and equipment for harvesting and threshing of rice. 86

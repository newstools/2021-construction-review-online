The Virgin hotel has been opened officially by the investor and businessman Richard Branson in Paradise, Nevada, Las Vegas.  Virgin Hotels and a group of investment companies purchased the Hard Rock Hotel for US$500 million in March 2018. The Hard Rock was then shut down on February 3, 2020, to allow for a US$200 million renovation and was set to be opened in late March however due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the opening date was pushed back to June. The hotel now has 1,504 rooms and a casino portion named Mohegan Sun Casino, operated by Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment.

Half of the slot machines are from the former Hard Rock. A sportsbook, operated by Betfred, is expected to open later this year. The numerous rooms are spread across three buildings; the Opal Tower, Canyon Tower, and Ruby Tower. The Ruby Tower is an all-suite building that features a mobile app that serves as an optional room key and also allows guests to order room service or check out. In addition, the app allows guests to control lights, televisions, and thermostats in their rooms. “It was so delightful seeing such energy and excitement in the air as we welcomed the latest Virgin Hotel to the family. We celebrated with a fun party, a lot of dancing, and of course, many surprises and delights for our guests. It felt great to welcome our partners, friends, and family to Virgin Hotels Las Vegas to celebrate the completion of the resort and the opening of our new beach club. Virgin Hotels Las Vegas is unstoppable!” Richard Branson stated. 93

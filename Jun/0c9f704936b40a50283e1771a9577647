Upon completion, Robbana-3 will produce around 100-150 barrels of oil per day. At the beginning of Q2 2021, Zenith Energy announced that it had acquired the Robbana concession that covers an area of ​​48 km2 on the island of Djerba, in the Gulf of Gabès. This, according to the company, was made possible owing to a conditional sale and purchase agreement (SPA) between Compagnie du Desert, a subsidiary of Zenith, and Candax Energy Inc., an international energy company involved in the exploration for, and the acquisition, development, and production of, natural gas and crude oil. The latter was the previous owner of the Robbana concession (the operation permit of which expires in 2034) as well as the El Bibane concession which was also acquired by Zenith within the same time frame. 92

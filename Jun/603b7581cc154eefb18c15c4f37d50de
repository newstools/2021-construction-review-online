The long-awaited tunnel loop was unveiled by Elon Musk at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) where Boring Co., showed how the tunnel would use Teslas as a vehicle fleet in the 1.7 mile-long stretch of underground road across three passenger stations. The tunnel system takes about two minutes to go through, bringing down the 45 minute walk time. The project took US$52.5 million to construct was completed in 18 months. The reasoning behind Musk’s vision for tunnel systems as transportation is multifaceted. The Boring Co. says a reduction in traffic and air pollution, weather resiliency, and easy expansion are some of the benefits of investing in tunnels as transportation infrastructure.

The Las  Vegas Convention Center tunnel system opening comes as the city continues to push its publicity campaign encouraging corporate events and increased tourism so as to revive the city economically as the U.S. economy begins to rebound from the pandemic. “We’re grateful to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and all local stakeholders for providing us the opportunity to construct our first commercial project in one of the world’s most dynamic destinations,” Boring Co. President Steve Davis said in a statement. “We are proud to have developed and delivered an exciting transportation solution to the Las Vegas Convention Center.” Other tunnels in construction for the Boring Co. include the R&D Tunnel and the Hyperloop Test Track in Hawthorne, California with cities such as Ft. Lauderdale considering the idea of making tunnels to transport passengers to the beach in Florida. 81

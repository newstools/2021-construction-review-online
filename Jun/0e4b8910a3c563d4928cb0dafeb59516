Fusion Investment Management, a subsidiary of Fusion Group that manages both local and international funds raised the funding of the mall purely through an equity arrangement, thereby de-risking the investment, making it safe for shareholders to hold it in the short and long term. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};Meru county Governor of Meru, Peter Munya confirmed the report and said the private equity fund had previously structured the financing of the mall as a Development Real Estate Investment Trust (D-Reit) which achieved a 38% subscription against the set threshold of 50% subscription. The project shareholders therefore dropped the DREIT in favour of private funding for the development. Also Read:US$42m Praise mall breaks ground in Mt. Kenya region “The US $7,4m is a follow-on investment from the original investment of US $4.3m hence total funding of about US $12m. The construction of the Meru Greenwood Park has now fully been funded privately by investors from United Kingdom and Finland as well as local land partners,” said Governor Munya. Meru Greenwood Park is located in the central business district on a 7-acre piece of land, along the Nairobi- Meru road. The project is envisaged to have a 25,000sqm shopping mall, Grade A office block occupying 20,000sqm, 50 apartments of 2 and 3 bedrooms, and a public car park that can fit 240 spaces. Other amenities include a swimming pool, sports club and cinema theatre. “This is one of the landmark developments and biggest single private investment in Meru and we intend to make it a destination for Eastern Mt Kenya region, supporting the development plan of the county. Meru is currently a hub of agricultural and tourism activities,” said the governor. “We have a first mover advantage in Meru and hence the decision to proceed with the circa 12,000 sqm shopping mall which is going to be a destination mall for the towns surrounding Meru,” said Fusion Group’s Chief Executive, Daniel Kamau. 86

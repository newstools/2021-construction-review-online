Eko Bridge in Lagos state, particularly the National Stadium bound from Costain to Alaka, is set to undergo reconstruction/rehabilitation works starting from the 4th of June this year. This was announced by the state Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde. According to Mr. Oladeinde, these works are necessary to complement the rehabilitation works at the opposite side of the bridge earlier embarked upon by the federal government.

According to Mr. Oladeinde, the state government has mapped alternative routes to help motorists maneuver around the site. Traffic from Apongbon to Alaka, stadium, inner Surulere, or Ikorodu Road, will be diverted to Eko Bridge to access the Costain Roundabout to Iponri, through Alaka and Funso Williams Avenue. Also, motorists from the Eko Bridge will have to navigate their desired destinations through Costain Roundabout to Abebe Village (by Nigerian Breweries Plc) through Eric Moore to Bode Thomas to Adeniran Ogunsanya, to access Shitta Roundabout (by Stadium under the bridge) to Funso Williams Avenue to Dorman-Long Bridge and Fadeyi-Ikorodu Road. They can also gain access to Apongbon through CMS Outer Marina Road to connect Ebute Metta Ikorodu Road and access their destinations from that point. Apongbon through CMS to Outer Marina to Adeniji Adele, Third Mainland Bridge, Adekunle to Herbert Macaulay Way, Jibowu, and Ikorodu road will also be passable. The state Commissioner for Transportation said that traffic directions and road signals will be deployed to minimize inconveniences along these routes. 92

According to the architect, the building structure can withstand not only the usual elements, such as strong winds or seismic events but also flooding. It is braced 70% by its concrete core and 30% by the structure of the steel porticos on its façade. The façades are particularly stunning, covering an area of more than 70,000 m², 41,000 m² for the tower, and 32,500 m² for the podium. To add to its strength, a tuned mass damper system will be installed in the last few storeys at the top of the tower in order to reduce oscillations. The Mohammed VI Tower is designed to be certified LEED Gold and HQE, complying with the highest international environmental quality standards. On its south façade, a total of 3350 m² of solar panels will be installed as well as an internal energy recovery system that will be used to warm water in the building. Rainwater recovery and wastewater recycling systems are also incorporated in the building’s design.  The project is planned to be completed in 2022.

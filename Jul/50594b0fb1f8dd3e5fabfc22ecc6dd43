Construction crews held a traditional topping-out ceremony in the Aztec Stadium, right next to the old Qualcomm Stadium, and lifted the last steel girder onto one of the marking frames. The bar was signed by the guests and carried a symbolic evergreen tree. The ceremony took place less than 14 months before the 35,000-seat stadium opened on September 3 next year. The stadium rises west of where Qualcomm Stadium has stood since 1967. After the NFL Chargers left for Los Angeles after the 2016 season, the state of San Diego won a vote that gave it the right to buy most of the Mission Valley property for an extended period of time. This allowed the San Diego campus to expand to bring a new football stadium, The Aztec Stadium.

We kept our heads down and worked hard, and slowly but surely we kept pulling people on board. I’m proud that we said we wanted to do something for the San Diego community and we’re right in the middle of it, ”said Sporting Director John David Wicker. 92

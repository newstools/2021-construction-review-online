AltaSea, an ocean research facility at the Port of Los Angeles is expected to receive a 2.2 MW solar array atop their utility. The solar panel installation will be carried out by PermaCity and will be their second largest installation at a port in the United States. Their SolarStrap roof mounting technology will be used on the project. Located on 35 acres at the Port of Los Angeles, AltaSea’s campus is set up to be the hub of an emerging blue economy estimated by the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation to create well over 126,000 direct jobs in the county of Los Angeles.

It will be used to export its energy to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power under the Feed-in Tariff. The tariff is delivering valuable in-basin power needed for LA’s electrification to mitigate climate change. The solar project has received a large amount of funding from True Green Energy LLC. Together with PermaCity they have funded and built most of the solar projects at the Port. Among the uses that will be powered by the four-acre AltaSea solar array includes famed oceanographer and explorer Dr. Robert Ballard’s planned 10,000-sq.-ft interactive research center. “This is a significant step forward for AltaSea’s environmental commitment, as well as signaling that AltaSea’s renovation is underway. With this Research and Development facility running net positive with renewable, green energy generated right on our rooftops, we are living out our mission to create a more sustainable future through the growth and acceleration of the blue economy. It is anticipated to pay wages upwards of $37.7 billion by 2023 in LA County alone,” said Tom McOsker, the AltaSea CEO. “I’m very proud that my district continues to be a leader on solar power. This AltaSea project follows in the footsteps of the 2017 Westmont project at the Port of Los Angeles, which was the largest solar rooftop array in the world when it was completed,” said U.S. Congressmember Nanette Barragán. 93

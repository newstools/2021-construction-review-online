It offers developers everything from a web interface to visualize plant and component design, to costs studies, and construction plans with an aim to accelerate the deployment of modular nuclear power plants. This project according to the federal minister of Science and Technology is transformative and a first of its kind in Nigeria. He said that it would radically change the way nuclear power plants are deployed, offering a substantially less expensive and less complicated solution.  Adding that it will also provide the country with a reliable and sustainable energy source, without the challenges preventing stable and reliable power generation. Onu reiterated the commitment of the government to promote the application of science, technology, and innovation within Nigeria, in line with Executive Order No. 5 of the Federal Government, and also appreciated Transcorp for the use of its innovative solutions to meet Nigeria’s electrical infrastructure needs. 100

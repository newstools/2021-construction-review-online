The artificial lake will sit on a 10,000 hectares of land in Lopei locality located between the districts of Moroto and Kotido. It will have a storage capacity of 40 million m3 and the stored water will also be used to generate electricity, feeding 6 MW into the Ugandan national electricity grid.

Uganda’s agriculture is vulnerable to climate change, increased drought and uneven rainfall. Water available in the Karamoja sub-region currently comes from dams located distance away from settlements including the Kobebe Dam in Moroto, which has now completely dried up and the structure has cracked due to the drought. Built in 2010, the facility was serving more than 5 million animals per day, with a storage capacity of 2.3 million m3. The artificial lake is set to improve the resilience of vulnerable populations. The government will further strengthen the resilience of Ugandans to climate change, through construction of 20 valley dams across the country. 92

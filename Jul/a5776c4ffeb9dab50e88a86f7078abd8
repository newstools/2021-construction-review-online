The Grand Theatre of Rabat (The Great Theatre of Rabat) is a large performing arts center that is under construction in Rabat, the capital city of Morocco since October 2014. Designed by Zaha Hadid and the Zaha Hadid Architects team, the Theatre has a fluid sculptural form that is inspired by the Bouregreg River, which is located between the ancient cities of Rabat and Sale. This form according to the architect creates a seamless spatial experience that flows into the main foyer, molding the grand staircases, and it is expected to provide an intuitive visual and physical guide for people visiting the facility.  Occupying a site of approximately 55 000 square meters, the facility on the inside features an 1800-seat theater, an open-air amphitheater with a capacity of 7000 people, a second experimental performance/rehearsal space, and an “extraordinary” restaurant able to accommodate up to 350 people.

It will be one of the centerpieces of a new 110-hectare mixed-use district on the shores of the Bou Regreg River that includes malls, residential areas, and a business district with skyscrapers on the Salé side of the river. A national archive and a new archaeological museum will also be factored into the proposed district. 100

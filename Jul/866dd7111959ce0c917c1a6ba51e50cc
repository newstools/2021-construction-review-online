The section between the Eastern and Southern bypasses will be a six-lane dual carriageway while the section to the Eastern Bypass and that from the Southern Bypass to James Gichuru will be a four-lane dual carriageway. The elevated highway will begin near Ole Sereni Hotel and run through the CBD along the Uhuru highway up to the James Gichuru junction. Haile Selassie Road, Kenyatta Avenue, and University Way will be below the elevated road. The over US $560m road project is the first major project in Kenya to be carried out through a PPP model. China Roads and Bridges Company (CRBC) won the project contract. Upon completion, the road is expected to significantly reduce the time spent on Mombasa road at rush hour from approximately two hours to between 10 and 15 minutes. 85

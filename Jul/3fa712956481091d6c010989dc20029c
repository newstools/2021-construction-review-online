The towers include 12 high-rise office buildings, five high-rise apartment buildings, two luxury hotels, and the 385.8m tall Iconic Tower that was recently topped off. The buildings are being built by China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) under a US$ 3bn contract that it won back in 2017. Other popular projects that are ongoing in the North African country’s NAC include Central Park and the New Garden City. The central park includes the construction of green spaces, lakes, playgrounds, bike lanes, restaurant complexes, recreational areas, and an area designated for setting up future investment projects. Upon completion, the park will be the largest of its kind in the Middle East region and the second-largest in the world, with a length of more than 10 kilometers. The New Garden City on the other hand includes the construction of 21,953 residential units (459 villas, and 385 buildings encompassing 21,494 flats), as well as  513 commercial units, in addition to facilities such as educational, medical, administrative, and entertainment establishments. Developed on over 885 feddans overlooking Central Park, the New Garden City was reportedly 92 percent complete with an 18 percent progress rate on the finishing works as of April this year. 91

The electricity from this dam will be evacuated through a power transfer station and accessories planned for construction as part of the project. Economic feasibility studies for the station have already been carried out by experts from the Egyptian Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy. In addition to providing electricity, the dam will also provide drinking water to 500 thousand people or its thereabouts, and provide supplementary irrigation for 12,600 to 16,800 hectares of land. The project will cost US$ 1.2 billion. 96

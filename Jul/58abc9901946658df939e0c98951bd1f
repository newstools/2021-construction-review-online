The key objectives of the project are to enhance the security of supply of the Namibian electrical grid by introducing 50 MW dispatchable generation capacity, provide grid support to compensate for a sudden loss of energy caused by the intermittent renewable energy sources on the grid, and adding dispatchable capacity to unlock and integrate a greater share of renewable energy. The project will also indirectly support COP 21 commitments to increase the share of renewable energy generation within the Southern Africa country to 70% or more by the year 2030 as well as the July 2017 National Renewable Energy Policy (NREP) of Namibia. 81

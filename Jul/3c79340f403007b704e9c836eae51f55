The project, under the Resiliency and Economic Development Initiative, will seek to mitigate the negative impacts of extreme weather conditions on the harbor entrance that was destroyed in 2019 by wind-driven waves, flooding, and sediment deposition in the navigation channel. High water levels, new sediment deposits, and wave agitation prevented safe refuge and navigation by large and small recreational watercraft. The port area includes the town of Newfane Marina, the Olcott Yacht Club, the Hedley Boat Company, McDonough Marine, and several private homes. Hence, the project will protect local businesses, boaters, and public/private real estate that play a vital role in the local economy which is based on sport fishing, and recreation.

A concrete dam with a height of 48 m and a crest length of 470 m will be constructed as well as a 300-m power line to connect to the existing 225 kV TL and less than 1-km of new access roads in addition to realignment of 1.4 km of the existing access road to route it around the new reservoir upstream of the dam. The implementation of the project is expected to take 40-45 months. 100

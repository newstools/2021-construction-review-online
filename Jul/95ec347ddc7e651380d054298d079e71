if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-box-4-0')};The development of the first phase of Sangomar offshore oil field (formerly known as the SNE offshore oil field) is expected to begin this month (July 2021) with a drilling campaign. This is according to Woodside Energy, the project operator and one of the members of the Rufisque Offshore, Sangomar Offshore, and Sangomar Deep Offshore (RSSD) joint venture that is developing the entire Sangomar offshore oil field that is located in the Rufisque, Sangomar, and Sangomar Deep Blocks, with a total area of 7,490km² within the Senegalese portion of the Mauritania-Senegal-Guinea Bissau Basin. if(typeof __ez_fad_position != 'undefined'){__ez_fad_position('div-gpt-ad-constructionreviewonline_com-banner-1-0')};Other members of the RSSD JV include Capricorn Senegal Limited (a subsidiary of Cairn Energy PLC) FAR Limited and Societé des Petroles du Sénégal (Petrosen). This phase will feature the deployment of a permanently moored floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) facility supplied by MODEC, a leading provider of solutions to the Floating Offshore Oil & Gas market, along with 23 oil production wells and associated subsea systems. With a length of between 250m and 325m, the FPSO (which will also hold the tie-backs of the oil production wells, along with water injection and gas interjection wells) will be installed at a water depth of 800m.

The oil storage tank of the FPSO unit will have a capacity to hold up to one million barrels of processed oil. The subsea system on the other hand will comprise wellheads and subsea trees, 9km to 22km in-line tees, up to six manifolds, flowlines, and risers ranging from 50km to 150km (connecting to the FPSO), 15km to 50km of flowline end terminals, and 15km to 70km of umbilicals for the monitoring of the wells. Upon completion, this phase will target approximately 230 million barrels of crude oil bringing Senegal’s first offshore oil development into service. 100

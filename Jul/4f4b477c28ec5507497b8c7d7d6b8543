The distance between JKIA and Nairobi City Centre is 20km, and normally it should take between 30 minutes and an hour at most to travel between the two points, however, it takes up to 120 minutes due to traffic on the usually busy Mombasa Road. The JKIA rail project, which will also be complemented by a Rapid Bus Transit System, upon completion will freely ship at least 500,000 urban commuters daily for a period of 12 months upon its completion. The number is expected to rise up to 1 000 000 in the following five years’ time. The project which is planned to be complete in 24 months after start of works, will be undertaken by French companies in conjunction with Kenyan state. Deals, alongside the CBD-JKIA railway link project, also include a 30-year concession for a consortium led by Vinci to operate a highway between Nairobi and Mau Summit in Western Kenya.  84

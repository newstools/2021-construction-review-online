This follows a consultancy contract signed between Solicitor General, Mr Francis Atoke with Mr Pius Muli, Group Managing Director of Symbion Uganda Ltd, the project developers. The US $60M project situated in Naguru, Kampala will have four components; the JLOS House, the Criminal Court House, the Appellate Courts and the headquarters of the Uganda Police Force. The JLOS House will provide office accommodation through a green and intelligent building for JLOS institutions as a one stop centre to facilitate and improve service delivery and increase access to JLOS services.

Construction period is expected to last two years. The project whose plans were born back in 1999 and moved through many stages including the use of Public-Private Partnership, was launched back in December 2019 with a 24 months completion timeframe. The delays to construct the facility has mainly been attributed to hurdles in procurement procedures. “JLOS institutions are in parts of the city that are not easily accessible yet the mandate of these institutions are complementary and require close proximity for communication, cooperation and coordination. The rented premises occupied by JLOS institutions were not custom designed for the provision of its services. Their location in different places has resulted in decreased accessibility of services to the public, especially the poor and marginalised who often have difficulties in finding their way to the right institution. The JLOS house will save government a lot of money in rent annually,” said Mr Atoke.

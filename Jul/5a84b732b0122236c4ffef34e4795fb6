It also includes the construction of technical and commercial premises located on either side of the bridge, public spaces, halls and services, passenger buildings, ancillary services, and operations such as reception. The implementation period for this project is 18 months. Lastly, the total investment required for the road infrastructure development program by FERA is approximately CFAF 39 billion. EBID will contribute CFAF 25 billion. The execution of these three projects is expected to help ensure a regular transport service on the targeted sections. For example in the Senegal-Mali corridor, it is hoped that the works will reduce the overall costs of transport between the two neighboring West African countries. 97

It will be located at 165 Somerset Street in New Brunswick and is expected to open for operation in 2024. In total, it will cost US$750 million to build the Jack and Sheryl Morris Cancer Center. It will offer inpatient and outpatient cancer treatment; the building will also house labs as it aims to be a worldwide hub for cancer research.

Cancer has touched each and every one of us in different ways. This new state-of-the-art cancer center arms us with the science, medicine, and critical resources to fight back like never before and gives new hope to thousands of current cancer patients and to those who have yet to be diagnosed,” said New Brunswick Mayor James Cahill. “Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey together with RWJBarnabas Health already serves as a destination for advanced cancer treatments including clinical trials, stem cell transplantation, proton therapy, and CAR T-cell therapy,” said RWJBarnabas Health CEO Barry Ostrowsky. 83

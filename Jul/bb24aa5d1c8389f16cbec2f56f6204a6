Moreover, stormwater drainage systems and box culverts will be installed in designated areas. The project is a fixed sum contract with a defined scope. This means CRBC has limitations for additional works. The project is being funded partly by the China Exim Bank and the national government of Kenya and was initially set for completion in 2022. Upon completion, it is expected to ease traffic congestion around Nairobi City, ensure rapid economic growth around the areas near the road, improve the safety of pedestrians and other non-motorized road users and ensure unimpeded traffic in the area. “By constructing this road, we have a complete Nairobi circular and you can now go around Nairobi without passing through the city centre. Just like while coming from Mombasa Road, you can use Southern Bypass as you go around Nairobi. This will create seamless connectivity within the city,” said Macharia. 86
